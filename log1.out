[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_4, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of puppies (Changes from 17 to 72), Number of puppies adopted each day (8)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we only need to consider the total number of puppies and the number of puppies adopted each day. The weight of the puppies is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of puppies in the shelter. This is done by adding the initial number of puppies (17) to the number of puppies that were brought in (55). This gives us a total of 72 puppies. If 8 puppies are adopted each day, we divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted each day (8) to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. The answer is 9 days.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time it will take to install the remaining windows. The weight of the building is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many windows are left to be installed. The building needed 9 windows and the builder had already installed 6 of them. So, 9 - 6 = 3 windows are left to be installed. If it takes 6 hours to install each window, then to install 3 windows it will take 3 * 6 = 18 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes to cook the remaining potatoes, we only need to consider the number of potatoes and the time it takes to cook each one. The temperature of the kitchen is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: The chef needs to cook 9 potatoes and has already cooked 7. To find out how many potatoes are left to cook, we subtract the number of potatoes already cooked (7) from the total number of potatoes needed (9). This gives us 2 potatoes left to cook. Since each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, we multiply the number of potatoes left (2) by the time it takes to cook one potato (3 minutes). This gives us 6 minutes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of apples and the number of students who wanted fruit. The weight of the food in the cafeteria is irrelevant to the question asked. 
Solution: The school cafeteria ordered a total of 33 red apples and 23 green apples which makes 56 apples in total. But, only 21 students wanted fruit. So, to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we subtract the number of students who wanted fruit (21) from the total number of apples ordered (56). 56 - 21 equals 35. So, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes for Amy to finish her homework, we only need to consider the total number of problems and the rate at which she can complete them. The weight of her backpack is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of problems Amy has for homework. She has 18 math problems and 6 spelling problems. Adding these together gives us 24 problems in total. If Amy can finish 4 problems in an hour, we divide the total number of problems (24) by the number of problems she can finish in an hour (4). 24 divided by 4 equals 6. Therefore, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all her homework.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_14, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of chicken wings (Changes from 8 to 18), Number of friends (Constant at 3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chicken wings each friend gets, we do not need to consider the temperature in the kitchen. The total number of chicken wings is the sum of the initial 8 and the additional 10 cooked, which is 18. These are to be equally shared among 3 friends.
Solution: The chef had 8 chicken wings already cooked and cooked 10 more for the group. This gives a total of 8 + 10 = 18 chicken wings. Since the wings are to be equally shared among 3 friends, each friend will get 18 / 3 = 6 chicken wings.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cupcakes needed, we need to consider the number of friends who attended and the number of cupcakes each person should have. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: Will invited 9 friends to his birthday party, but 4 couldn't come. This means 5 friends (9 - 4) were able to attend. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 8, he would need to multiply the number of attendees by the number of cupcakes per person. So, 5 (friends) * 8 (cupcakes) = 40 cupcakes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of birds in the pet store. The area of the space is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find the total number of birds by multiplying the number of birds in each cage by the number of cages.
Solution: Each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets, so each cage has 8 + 2 = 10 birds. Since there are 4 cages, we multiply the number of birds in each cage by the number of cages: 10 birds * 4 cages = 40 birds.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, the temperature of the room is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the total number of students trying out and the number of students who didn't get picked.
Solution: First, subtract the number of students who didn't get picked (15) from the total number of students trying out (25). This gives us 10 students who were picked for the team. Since these students were divided into 2 groups, we divide the number of picked students (10) by 2. 10 divided by 2 equals 5. Therefore, there are 5 students in each group.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_24, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total points scored (39), Emily's points (23), Points scored by each other player (2)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of players on Emily's team, the humidity in the gym is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total points scored, Emily's points, and the points scored by each other player.
Solution: First, we subtract the points scored by Emily from the total points scored by the team. This gives us the total points scored by the rest of the team. So, 39 (total points) - 23 (Emily's points) = 16 points. Since each of the other team members scored 2 points, we divide the total points scored by the rest of the team by 2 to find the number of other team members. So, 16/2 = 8. Therefore, there were 8 other players on Emily's team.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_26, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Initial height of tree (4 feet), rate of growth per year (5 feet), desired height (29 feet)
Explanation: The problem deals with the growth of the tree in terms of height, so the weight of the tree is irrelevant. To find out how many years it will take for the tree to reach 29 feet, we first subtract the initial height of the tree from the desired height. We then divide this by the rate at which the tree grows every year.
Solution: The initial height of the tree is 4 feet. The desired height is 29 feet. So, the tree needs to grow 29-4 = 25 feet. The tree grows at a rate of 5 feet per year. Therefore, it will take 25/5 = 5 years for the tree to reach 29 feet.

Explanation: The weight of the bears is not relevant to the number of shelves used, so we can ignore this information. The problem deals with the total number of bears and the number of bears that each shelf can hold. 
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of bears. The store initially had 6 bears and received another shipment of 18 bears. So, the total number of bears is 6 + 18 = 24 bears. Then, we divide the total number of bears by the number of bears that can fit on one shelf. Since each shelf can hold 6 bears, we divide 24 by 6. This gives us 4. Therefore, they used 4 shelves.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tables needed to accommodate the people who attended the luncheon. The weight of the food is irrelevant in this context. We first need to calculate the number of people who attended by subtracting the number who didn't show up from the total number invited. Then, we divide this by the number of people each table can hold to find the number of tables needed.
Solution: First, we find out how many people actually attended the luncheon by subtracting the number of people who didn't show up (10) from the total number of people invited (24). This gives us 14 people. Next, we determine how many tables are needed. Since each table holds 7 people, we divide the number of attendees (14) by the number of people each table can hold (7). This gives us 2 tables.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of problems Sarah had to complete. The weight of Sarah before and after completing her homework is irrelevant to the calculation of the total number of problems. We only need to consider the number of pages of homework and the number of problems per page.
Solution: First, we find the total number of pages Sarah had to work on. This is done by adding the number of math pages (4) and the number of reading pages (6). This gives us a total of 10 pages. Since each page has 4 problems, we multiply the total number of pages (10) by the number of problems per page (4). 10 multiplied by 4 gives us 40.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_34, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of books (Total is $37), Jonathan's savings ($8)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of books and Jonathan's savings, there is no need to consider his weight when calculating how much more money he needs.
Solution: First, we add up the cost of all three books. The dictionary costs $11, the dinosaur book costs $19, and the children's cookbook costs $7. So, 11 + 19 + 7 equals $37. This is the total cost of all three books. Jonathan has already saved $8. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract his savings from the total cost. So, 37 - 8 equals $29. Therefore, Jonathan needs $29 more to buy all three books.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_35, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of treasures (Changes from 5 to 2), Points per treasure (Constant at 9)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total score, which is determined by the number of treasures found and the points per treasure, there is no need to consider the volume of the room when calculating the score.
Solution: In order to find the total score, we multiply the number of treasures found on each level by the points scored for each treasure and then add the two results. So, for the first level, Rachel found 5 treasures and scored 9 points for each, which gives 5*9 = 45 points. On the second level, she found 2 treasures, which gives 2*9 = 18 points. Adding these two results, we get 45 + 18 = 63 points.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_36, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Money Kaleb has (Changes from 12 dollars to 4 dollars), Cost of toys (Constant at 2 dollars)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Kaleb has and how many toys he can buy with it. The weight of Kaleb is irrelevant to this problem.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Kaleb has left after buying the game. He started with 12 dollars and spent 8 dollars on the game, so he has 12 - 8 = 4 dollars left. Then, we find out how many 2 dollar toys he can buy with this money. Since each toy costs 2 dollars, he can buy 4 / 2 = 2 toys.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_37, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pictures (Changes from 5 and 35 to 40), Number of albums (Constant at 8)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pictures and albums, we do not need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the number of pictures in each album.
Solution: First, we find the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded to Facebook. This is done by adding the number of pictures she uploaded from her phone (5) and her camera (35). This gives us a total of 40 pictures. Then, we divide this total number of pictures by the number of albums she sorted them into, which is 8. 40 divided by 8 equals 5. Therefore, there were 5 pictures in each album.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pastries, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pastries when counting the total quantity sold.
Solution: Wendy made a total of 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, which equals to 33 pastries. After the sale, she had 24 pastries left. To find out how many pastries she sold, we subtract the number of pastries left (24) from the total number of pastries she made (33). So, 33 - 24 equals 9. Therefore, Wendy sold 9 pastries.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of vans needed, the temperature at the zoo is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of students, adults, and the capacity of each van.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of people going on the trip. This is done by adding the number of students (40) and adults (14) which gives us 54. Since each van can hold 9 people, we divide the total number of people (54) by the number of people each van can hold (9). This gives us 6 vans. Therefore, they will need 6 vans for the trip.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of trips Luke has to make to carry all the trays, we only need to consider the total number of trays and how many trays Luke can carry at a time. The change in Luke's weight is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: Luke has to pick up a total of 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, which makes 36 trays. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 36 divided by 4 trips, which equals 9 trips.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of pieces of clothing that can go in each of the small loads. The weight of the clothes is irrelevant to this calculation. We start with 47 pieces of clothing and subtract the 17 that were washed in one load, leaving us with 30 pieces. These 30 pieces are then divided equally among 5 loads.
Solution: Luke initially had 47 pieces of clothing. He washed 17 of them in one load, leaving him with 47 - 17 = 30 pieces of clothing. He then decided to split these 30 pieces into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we divide the total number of remaining pieces (30) by the number of loads (5). So, 30 divided by 5 equals 6. Therefore, 6 pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of good games, we need to consider the total number of games John bought and the number of games that didn't work. The weight of the games is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: John initially bought 21 games from a friend and then 8 more at a garage sale, making a total of 21 + 8 = 29 games. However, 23 of these games didn't work. So, the number of good games he ended up with is 29 - 23 = 6.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the students when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we start with the initial number of students (40), subtract the students who left (14), and add the new students who came (26). So, 40 - 14 = 26. Then, 26 + 26 = 52.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of bad carrots, we don't need to consider the humidity of the garden when calculating the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find the total number of carrots picked by Nancy and her mom by adding the number of carrots Nancy picked (38) and the number her mom picked (47). This gives us a total of 85 carrots. Then, we subtract the number of good carrots (71) from the total number of carrots (85) to find the number of bad carrots. 85 minus 71 equals 14, so there were 14 bad carrots.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of items and the money Dalton has. The weight of Dalton is irrelevant in this context. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how much all the items Dalton wants to buy cost. The jump rope costs $7, the board game costs $12, and the playground ball costs $4. Adding these together gives us $23. Dalton has $6 from his allowance and his uncle gave him $13. Adding these together gives us $19. To find out how much more money Dalton needs, we subtract the total amount he has ($19) from the total cost of the items ($23). This gives us $4, which is the amount Dalton needs to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_49, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of worksheets (15), Number of problems per worksheet (3), Number of worksheets already graded (7)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of problems the teacher has to grade, we do not need to consider the weight of the worksheets. We only need to consider the number of worksheets, the number of problems on each worksheet, and the number of worksheets already graded.
Solution: The teacher has 15 worksheets, each with 3 problems. So, the total number of problems is 15 * 3 = 45. She has already graded 7 worksheets, which means she has graded 7 * 3 = 21 problems. To find out how many more problems she has to grade, we subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems. So, 45 - 21 = 24.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pictures, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures. She put 37 pictures into one album. To find out how many pictures she put into the other two albums, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures uploaded. So, 41 - 37 = 4. Since she put the remaining pictures into 2 different albums, we divide the remaining number of pictures by 2. So, 4 / 2 = 2. Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the other two albums.

Solution: First, we need to find out how many players are left after 7 players quit. We start with 16 players and subtract the 7 who left, which leaves us with 9 players. Each of these players has 8 lives, so to find the total number of lives, we multiply the number of players (9) by the number of lives each player has (8). 9 times 8 equals 72.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_63, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of problems per worksheet (Constant at 4), Total number of worksheets (Constant at 16), Number of worksheets graded (Constant at 8)
Explanation: The weight of the worksheet is irrelevant to the problem as we are interested in the number of problems left to grade. We know that each worksheet has 4 problems and the teacher has 16 worksheets in total. She has already graded 8 worksheets. 
Solution: To find the total number of problems, we multiply the number of problems per worksheet (4) by the total number of worksheets (16), which gives us 64 problems. The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, which means she has graded 8*4=32 problems. To find out how many problems are left, we subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems. So, 64-32=32. Therefore, the teacher has 32 more problems to grade.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_64, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours worked (Changes from 7 to 2), Wage per hour (Constant at 5 dollars)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money George made, we need to consider the number of hours he worked and his wage per hour. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: To find out how much money George made in those two days, we first need to calculate how much he made each day. On Monday, he worked 7 hours and since he makes 5 dollars an hour, he made 7 * 5 = 35 dollars. On Tuesday, he worked 2 hours, so he made 2 * 5 = 10 dollars. To find the total amount he made, we add the amounts for the two days together. So, 35 + 10 = 45 dollars.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of tables needed, the temperature in the room is irrelevant. We need to focus on the number of people who attended the luncheon and the capacity of each table.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many people actually attended the luncheon. This is done by subtracting the number of people who didn't show up (7) from the total number of people invited (47). This gives us 40 people. Next, we need to find out how many tables are needed. Since each table holds 5 people, we divide the total number of people (40) by the number of people each table can hold (5). This gives us 8. Therefore, 8 tables are needed.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of apples and the number of students who wanted fruit. The weight of the apples is irrelevant to the question asked. We need to find the difference between the total number of apples and the number of students who wanted fruit to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with.
Solution: The school cafeteria ordered a total of 42 red apples and 7 green apples, which makes 49 apples in total. If only 9 students wanted fruit, we subtract the number of students who wanted fruit (9) from the total number of apples (49). 49 minus 9 equals 40. So, the cafeteria ended up with 40 extra apples.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_77, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Consecutive even numbers (Remain the same)
Explanation: As the problem deals with consecutive even numbers, which remain the same, there is no need to consider the change in humidity when determining the smallest of the three numbers.
Solution: Let's denote the smallest of the three numbers as 'x'. Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the next two numbers will be 'x+2' and 'x+4'. According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 162. So, we can write the equation as follows: x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 162. Simplifying this equation gives 3x + 6 = 162. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives 3x = 156. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 52. Therefore, the smallest of the three numbers is 52.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, the weight of the vase is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total number of flowers and how many each vase can hold.
Solution: First, you need to find the total number of flowers. This is done by adding the number of carnations (7) and roses (47), which gives you 54 flowers. Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, you then divide the total number of flowers (54) by the number of flowers each vase can hold (6). This gives you 9 vases. Therefore, you would need 9 vases to hold all the flowers.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of small gardens, which can be calculated by dividing the number of remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden. The humidity of the garden is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Sarah started with 21 seeds. She planted 12 in the big garden. This leaves her with 21 - 12 = 9 seeds. Since she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, the number of small gardens she had is 9 / 3 = 3.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_94, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of video games (Changes from 15 to 6), Price per game ($5)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of working video games and their price, so there is no need to consider the weight of the video games when calculating the total earnings.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many video games are working. Mike had 15 video games and 9 of them weren't working, so we subtract 9 from 15, which gives us 6. These are the working games. If he sells each working game for $5, we multiply the number of working games (6) by the price of each game ($5). 6 times 5 equals 30. So, Mike could earn $30 by selling his working video games.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_95, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of team members (Changes from 15 to 9), Points scored per member (Constant at 3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total points scored, we need to consider the number of team members who showed up and the points each member scored. The weight of the team members is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many team members showed up to the game. We do this by subtracting the number of team members who didn't show up (6) from the total number of team members (15). This gives us 9 team members who showed up. Then, to find the total number of points scored, we multiply the number of team members who showed up (9) by the number of points each member scored (3). 9 multiplied by 3 equals 27.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_96, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money Frank has (Changes from 3 dollars to 40 dollars), Cost of toys (Constant at 8 dollars)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Frank has and the cost of toys, there is no need to consider the weight of the piggy bank. We first need to calculate the total amount of money Frank has by adding his savings and his allowance. Then, we divide this total by the cost of one toy to find out how many toys Frank can buy.
Solution: First, we add the money Frank had saved (3 dollars) to the money he received for his allowance (37 dollars). This gives us a total of 40 dollars. Then, we divide this total by the cost of one toy (8 dollars) to find out how many toys Frank can buy. 40 divided by 8 equals 5.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_97, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of tickets (Changes from 13 to 4), Cost per ticket (Constant at 9 dollars)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money spent on ferris wheel tickets, we need to find out how many tickets were used and then multiply by the cost per ticket. The weight of Adam is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel. He started with 13 tickets and had 4 left, so he used 13 - 4 = 9 tickets. Then, since each ticket costs 9 dollars, we multiply the number of tickets used (9) by the cost per ticket (9 dollars) to find out how much Adam spent. So, 9 tickets * 9 dollars per ticket = 81 dollars.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_99, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of candies (Changes from 67 to 63)
Explanation: The problem is about the number of candies left after some are eaten. The weight of the candies is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we add the number of candies Janet and her sister received. Janet had 34 candies and her sister had 33 candies. So, 34 + 33 = 67 candies in total. Then, we subtract the number of candies they ate on the first night, which is 4. So, 67 - 4 = 63 candies left.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of problems Faye had for homework, her weight is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the total number of problems and subtract the ones she completed at school.
Solution: Faye had a total of 46 math problems and 9 science problems for homework, which makes a total of 55 problems (46 + 9 = 55). If she finished 40 of the problems at school, then she would have 15 problems left to do for homework (55 - 40 = 15).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_101, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sodas (Changes from 4 and 44 to 48), Number of sodas each shelf can hold (6)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of shelves that would be filled up, we need to consider the total number of sodas and the capacity of each shelf. The weight of the sodas is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of sodas Cody bought. He bought 4 regular sodas and 44 diet sodas, which totals to 48 sodas (4+44). His fridge can hold 6 sodas on each shelf. So, to find out how many shelves he would fill up, we divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold. 48 divided by 6 equals 8. Therefore, Cody would fill up 8 shelves.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_102, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of flowers (Changes from 0 to 12)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of flowers, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Katie or the flowers when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Katie picked a total of 3 tulips and 9 roses, which makes 12 flowers in total. If she only used 10 of these flowers, then the number of extra flowers she picked is found by subtracting the number of flowers used (10) from the total number of flowers picked (12). So, 12 - 10 equals 2. Therefore, Katie picked 2 extra flowers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_103, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of apples (Changes from 62 to 54), Number of apples per pie (9)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pies that can be made, we only need to consider the number of apples and the number of apples per pie. The weight of the apples is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many apples are left after the cafeteria handed out 8 to students. So, we subtract 8 from 62 which gives us 54. Then, since each pie takes 9 apples, we divide the number of remaining apples (54) by the number of apples per pie (9). This gives us 6 pies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_104, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of files (Changes from 82 to 45), Number of files per folder (Constant at 5)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of folders, which is determined by the number of files and the number of files per folder. The weight of the files is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many files Wendy had left after deleting some. She started with 82 files and deleted 37, so she had 82 - 37 = 45 files left. Then, since she put these files into folders with 5 files in each one, we divide the number of files by the number of files per folder to find the number of folders. So, 45 / 5 = 9 folders.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Kaleb could earn from selling his working video games, the weight of the video games is irrelevant. We need to focus on the number of working video games and the price per game.
Solution: Kaleb had 10 video games, out of which 8 weren't working. So, the number of working video games is 10 - 8 = 2. If each game is sold for $6, the total money he could earn is 2 * $6 = $12.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_107, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total weight of recycled paper (Changes from 0 to 27 pounds)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total weight of paper recycled, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the total points earned.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total weight of the paper recycled. This is done by adding the weight of the paper Haley recycled (11 pounds) to the weight of the paper her friends recycled (16 pounds). This gives us a total of 27 pounds. Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds of paper recycled, we divide the total weight of the paper recycled (27 pounds) by 3. This gives us 9 points.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_108, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of customers (Changes from 22 to 8), People per table (Constant at 4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tables, which can be found by dividing the number of customers by the number of people per table. The area of the section is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many customers are left after 14 of them left. We do this by subtracting 14 from the total number of customers, which is 22. So, 22 - 14 = 8. Then, we divide the number of remaining customers (8) by the number of people at each table (4). So, 8 / 4 = 2. Therefore, the waiter had 2 tables.
