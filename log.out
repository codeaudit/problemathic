[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_13, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of problems (Changes from 18 math problems and 6 spelling problems to 24 total problems), Problems per hour (Constant at 4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it will take Amy to finish her homework, the weight of her backpack is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total number of problems and the rate at which she can complete them.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of problems Amy has for homework. This is done by adding the number of math problems (18) and spelling problems (6) which equals to 24 problems. If Amy can finish 4 problems in an hour, we then divide the total number of problems (24) by the number of problems she can finish in an hour (4). So, 24 divided by 4 equals 6. Therefore, it will take Amy 6 hours to finish all her homework.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_14, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of friends (3), Number of chicken wings (Changes from 8 to 18)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chicken wings each friend would get, the humidity in the restaurant is not relevant to the solution. The total number of chicken wings is the sum of the initial 8 and the additional 10 cooked, which is 18. These are then divided equally among the 3 friends.
Solution: The chef had 8 chicken wings cooked and then cooked 10 more. So, the total number of chicken wings is 8 + 10 = 18. Since the chicken wings were divided equally among 3 friends, each friend got 18 / 3 = 6 chicken wings.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_16, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of friends (Changes from 9 to 5), Number of cupcakes per person (Constant at 8)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of friends attending the party and the number of cupcakes each person should have. The volume of the room is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Will invited 9 friends to his party, but 4 couldn't come. This means that 5 friends (9-4) are coming to the party. If he wants each person to have exactly 8 cupcakes, he needs to multiply the number of attendees by the number of cupcakes per person. So, 5 (friends) * 8 (cupcakes per person) = 40 cupcakes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of birds, which is determined by the number of cages and the number of birds per cage. The area covered by the cages is irrelevant to the total number of birds.
Solution: Each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets, making a total of 10 birds per cage. Since there are 4 cages, we multiply the number of birds per cage (10) by the number of cages (4). 10 multiplied by 4 gives us 40.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of problems left to be graded. The weight of the worksheets is not relevant to the calculation. We know that each worksheet has 7 problems and the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many worksheets are left to be graded. Since the teacher has already graded 8 worksheets out of 17, there are 17 - 8 = 9 worksheets left. Each worksheet has 7 problems, so the total number of problems left to be graded is 9 worksheets * 7 problems per worksheet = 63 problems.

Solution: The pet store initially had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, which totals to 18 cats (13 + 5). During a sale, they sold 10 cats. So, to find out how many cats they have left, we subtract the number of cats sold (10) from the total number of cats they initially had (18). Therefore, 18 - 10 = 8.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_24, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total points scored (39), Emily's points (23), Points per player (2)
Explanation: The problem is about determining the number of players on Emily's team. The humidity in the gym is irrelevant to this calculation. We know that Emily's team scored a total of 39 points, and Emily herself scored 23 of these points. This leaves 16 points that were scored by the rest of the team. Since each of the other players scored 2 points, we can divide the remaining points by 2 to find out how many other players there were.
Solution: Emily's team scored a total of 39 points. Emily scored 23 of these points. Therefore, the rest of the team scored 39 - 23 = 16 points. Since each of the other players scored 2 points, the number of other players is 16 / 2 = 8. Therefore, including Emily, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of lawns Edward mowed and how much he earns per lawn. His weight, which changes in the problem, is irrelevant to the calculation of his earnings.
Solution: Edward was supposed to mow 17 lawns. However, he forgot to mow 9 of them. Therefore, he only mowed 17 - 9 = 8 lawns. Since he earns 4 dollars for each lawn he mows, he earned a total of 8 * 4 = 32 dollars.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_26, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Initial height of tree (4 feet), Desired height of tree (29 feet), Growth rate per year (5 feet)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the growth of the tree in terms of height, we do not need to consider the weight of the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow from its initial height to the desired height.
Solution: To find out how many years it will take for the tree to grow to 29 feet, we subtract the initial height of the tree (4 feet) from the desired height (29 feet). This gives us 25 feet. We then divide this by the rate at which the tree grows every year (5 feet per year). 25 divided by 5 equals 5. Therefore, it will take 5 years for the tree to grow to 29 feet.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chicken wings each friend got, the temperature of the restaurant is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of chicken wings and the number of friends.
Solution: In order to find the number of chicken wings each friend got, we add the number of chicken wings the chef already had (9) and the number of chicken wings he cooked more (7). This gives us a total of 16 chicken wings. Since there are 4 friends, we divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends. 16 divided by 4 equals 4. So, each friend got 4 chicken wings.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the books and the money Jonathan has saved. The weight of Jonathan is irrelevant to the problem as it does not affect the cost of the books or the money he has saved.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $11, the dinosaur book costs $19, and the children's cookbook costs $7. Adding these together, we get $37. Jonathan has already saved $8. To find out how much more he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books. So, $37 - $8 = $29. Therefore, Jonathan needs $29 more to buy all three books.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of trips Luke needs to make, which is determined by the number of trays he needs to pick up and the number of trays he can carry at a time, there is no need to consider Luke's weight when calculating the total number of trips.
Solution: Luke needs to pick up a total of 36 trays (20 from one table and 16 from another). Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, we divide the total number of trays (36) by the number of trays he can carry at a time (4). This gives us 9 trips. However, since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, Luke will need to make 9 trips in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pieces of clothing that could go in each load, we do not need to consider the weight of the clothing. We only need to know the total number of pieces of clothing and the number of loads.
Solution: Luke initially had 47 pieces of clothing. He washed 17 of them in one load, leaving him with 47 - 17 = 30 pieces of clothing. He then decided to split these remaining pieces into 5 equal loads. To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of these loads, we divide the total number of remaining pieces (30) by the number of loads (5). So, 30 divided by 5 equals 6. Therefore, each of the small loads could contain 6 pieces of clothing.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of students.
Solution: At the start of the year, there were 40 students. During the year, 14 students left, so we subtract 14 from 40 which gives us 26. Then, 26 new students came to school, so we add 26 to the remaining 26 students. 26 and 26 make 52.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of vans needed, so the speed of the vans is irrelevant. We need to consider the total number of people going on the trip and the capacity of each van.
Solution: First, we find the total number of people going on the trip by adding the number of students (12) and adults (3), which gives us 15. Since each van can hold 5 people, we divide the total number of people (15) by the number of people each van can hold (5). This gives us 3. Therefore, they will need 3 vans for the trip.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of books, which is dependent on the number of shelves and the number of books on each shelf, there is no need to consider the weight of the bookcase when calculating the total number of books.
Solution: To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf. For the mystery books, we have 3 shelves with 9 books each, which gives us 3*9 = 27 books. For the picture books, we have 5 shelves with 9 books each, which gives us 5*9 = 45 books. Adding these together, we get 27 + 45 = 72 books in total.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of shelves used, which depends on the total number of bears and the number of bears per shelf. The weight of the bears is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: The toy store initially had 5 stuffed bears and received another 7 in a shipment, giving a total of 5 + 7 = 12 bears. The store places 6 bears on each shelf, so to find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of bears (12) by the number of bears per shelf (6). So, 12 divided by 6 equals 2. Therefore, they used 2 shelves.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to paint the remaining rooms, the humidity in the building is not relevant. We only need to consider the number of rooms and the time taken to paint each room.
Solution: The painter needs to paint 9 rooms and each room takes 8 hours to paint. This means the total time needed is 9 rooms * 8 hours/room = 72 hours. If he has already painted 5 rooms, he has spent 5 rooms * 8 hours/room = 40 hours. The remaining time is the total time needed minus the time already spent, which is 72 hours - 40 hours = 32 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money George made, we need to consider the number of hours he worked and his hourly wage. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: To find out how much money George made in those two days, we first need to calculate how much he made each day. On Monday, he worked 7 hours and he makes 5 dollars an hour. So, 7 hours * 5 dollars/hour = 35 dollars. On Tuesday, he worked 2 hours. So, 2 hours * 5 dollars/hour = 10 dollars. To find the total amount he made, we add the amount he made on Monday and Tuesday. So, 35 dollars + 10 dollars = 45 dollars.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_80, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total money earned (Changes from 0 to 45 dollars), Money spent per week (Constant at 5 dollars)
Explanation: The problem deals with how long Jerry's money will last him. His weight is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to consider the total money he earned and how much he spends per week.
Solution: First, find out how much money Jerry made in total. He made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating. So, 14 + 31 = 45 dollars. If Jerry spends 5 dollars a week, we need to find out how many weeks 45 dollars would last. We do this by dividing the total amount of money Jerry has (45 dollars) by how much he spends each week (5 dollars). So, 45 ÷ 5 = 9 weeks. Therefore, the money would last Jerry 9 weeks.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students in each group, we don't need to consider the humidity in the room. We only need to know the total number of students trying out, the number of students who didn't get picked, and the number of groups.
Solution: First, subtract the number of students who didn't get picked for the team from the total number of students trying out. This gives us 58 - 10 = 48 students who got picked for the team. Then, divide this number by the number of groups to find out how many students would be in each group. So, 48 ÷ 8 = 6 students per group.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of vases needed to hold a certain number of flowers. The weight of the vase is irrelevant to this calculation. We only need to consider the total number of flowers and the capacity of each vase.
Solution: To find out how many vases are needed, we first need to find out the total number of flowers. We add the number of carnations (7) and roses (47) to get 54. Since each vase can hold 6 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers (54) by the number of flowers each vase can hold (6). This gives us 9. Therefore, 9 vases are needed to hold all the flowers.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of working video games and the price per game. The weight of the games is irrelevant to the calculation of the total money Mike could earn.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many video games are working. Mike had 15 video games and 9 of them weren't working. So, we subtract 9 from 15 which gives us 6. These are the working video games. If he wanted to sell each working game for $5, we multiply the number of working games (6) by the price of each game ($5). 6 times 5 equals 30. So, Mike could earn $30.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the students when counting the total quantity.
Solution: At the start of the year, there were 8 students in the fourth grade. During the year, 5 students left, which leaves us with 8 - 5 = 3 students. Then, 8 new students came to school, so we add these to the remaining students: 3 + 8 = 11 students. So, at the end of the year, there were 11 students in the fourth grade.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of pies and how they are arranged in rows, so the temperature changes in the kitchen are irrelevant. 
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of pies Mrs. Hilt baked. She baked 16 pecan pies and 14 apple pies, which totals to 30 pies (16 + 14 = 30). If she wants to arrange all of the pies in rows of 5 pies each, we need to divide the total number of pies by the number of pies in each row. So, 30 divided by 5 equals 6. Therefore, she will have 6 rows of pies.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of groups that can be formed, we don't need to consider the weight of the debate team. We only need to know the total number of students and the number of students in each group.
Solution: In order to find the total number of groups, we add the number of boys (28) and girls (4) to get the total number of students (32). Then we divide the total number of students (32) by the number of students in each group (4). 32 divided by 4 equals 8.

Solution: Maria bought 2 chairs and 2 tables, making a total of 4 pieces of furniture. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture, we multiply the total number of furniture (4) by the time spent on each (8). 4 multiplied by 8 equals 32.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total weight of paper recycled and the points earned, there is no need to consider the humidity of the room when calculating the total points earned.
Solution: First, we need to find the total amount of paper recycled by Zoe and her friends. Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds. So, 25 + 23 = 48 pounds. For every 8 pounds of paper recycled, they earn one point. So, to find the total points earned, we divide the total pounds by 8. So, 48 / 8 = 6. Therefore, they earned 6 points.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, the humidity in the gym is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of girls, boys, and students who were called back.
Solution: First, we add the number of girls (6) and boys (48) who tried out for the team. This gives us a total of 54 students. Then, we subtract the number of students who got called back (7) from the total number of students who tried out. 54 minus 7 equals 47, which is the number of students who didn't make the cut.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chocolate bars sold and their cost, there is no need to consider the weight of the chocolate bars when calculating the total money made.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars Wendy sold. Since she sold all but 3 bars out of 9, she sold 9 - 3 = 6 bars. Each bar costs $3, so the total amount of money she made is 6 bars * $3/bar = $18.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost for a group to eat at a restaurant. The cost is determined by the number of adults in the group, as kids eat free. The area of the restaurant is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: To find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of adults by the cost of an adult meal. The number of adults is the total number of people (15) minus the number of kids (8), which is 7. The cost of an adult meal is $5. So, 7 adults times $5 per adult equals $35.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cages, which depends on the number of puppies and the number of puppies each cage can hold, there is no need to consider the weight of the puppies or cages when calculating the total number of cages.
Solution: The pet store initially had 18 puppies. After selling 3, they were left with 18 - 3 = 15 puppies. Since each cage can hold 5 puppies, the number of cages needed is 15 / 5 = 3.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pies that can be made, we need to consider the number of apples and how many apples are needed for each pie. The weight of the apples is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many apples were left after they handed out 27 to students. We do this by subtracting 27 from 47 which gives us 20. Then, since each pie takes 4 apples, we divide the number of apples left (20) by the number of apples needed for each pie (4). 20 divided by 4 equals 5. Therefore, they could make 5 pies.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total points Emily scored, the humidity in the room is irrelevant and does not affect the final score. 
Solution: Emily started with 16 points from the first round. She then added 33 points from the second round to have a total of 49 points. However, she lost 48 points in the last round. So, we subtract 48 from 49 to get 1. Therefore, Emily had 1 point at the end of the game.

Solution: Cody initially had 45 dollars. For his birthday, he received an additional 9 dollars, which increased his total to 54 dollars (45 + 9). However, he then spent 19 dollars on a new game, which reduced his total to 35 dollars (54 - 19).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_146, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of people in line (Changes from 30 to 25)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people in line, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In order to find the total number of people in line, we start with the initial number of people (30), subtract the number who left (10), and then add the number who got in line (5). So, 30 minus 10 is 20, and 20 plus 5 is 25.
