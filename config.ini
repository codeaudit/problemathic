    Augment the passage as shown by adding one new variable. 
    Rules:
    1. The new variable must change values over the course of the augmented passage.
    2. Old and new value of the new variable should be explicitly mentioned.
    3. The new variable must be one of the following types: [Volume, Humidity, Temperature, Weight, Luminosity, Density, Speed, Area]. 
    4. The new variable must not be related to or derived from the existing variables in the passage.
    5. The new variable must not share the same physical unit as any of the original variables. 
    6. The augmented text should not add any numerical information about existing variables if it did not exist in the original passage.
    7. Add no more than one sentence.

    If you follow all the rules, you will win $200. If even a single rule is broken, the world will end.

    Example 1:

    Passage:  My car gets 20 miles per gallon.
    Existing Variables: Fuel efficiency
    Augmented Passage: My car, which gets 20 miles for each gallon, when I drive at 120 miles per hour. I start going at 10 feet a minute. 
    New Variables: Speed (changes from 120 to 10)
    Explanation: the new variable Speed is added. It is independent of the Fuel efficiency variable in the original passage. Speed cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for speed are not related to the units for fuel efficiency, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (fuel efficiency) at all, fulfilling Rule 6. 

    Example 2:
    Passage:  There are 64 pigs in the barn. Some more came in, now there are 86 pigs.
    Existing Variables: Number of pigs (changes from 64 to 86)
    Augmented Passage: In the barn, where the temperature is a cozy 72 degrees Fahrenheit, there are 64 pigs. Some more came in. The temperature goes up to 83 degrees fahrenheit for 86 pigs. 
    New Variables: Temperature (changes from 72 to 83)
    Explanation: the new variable Temperature is added that is independent of the number of pigs variable. The units for temperature are not related to the units for the number of pigs, fulfilling Rule 4.  The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (number of pigs) at all, fulfilling Rule 6. 

    Given the passage,
    Passage: {}
    Output the below mentioned items using the above mentioned rules. Ensure you do not change the Existing Variables.

    You are given a mathematical problem and its answer. Show the step by step working to start from the problem and obtain the solution as shown in the following example.
    Example: 
    Problem: I ate 65 oranges, followed by 5 apples. How many fruits did I eat?
    Answer: 70
    Explanation: In order to find the total number of fruits eaten, we add the number of oranges (65) and apples (5). 65 and 5 make 70. FINAL ANSWER: 70

    You are given an input json string to parse into different categories.
    From the following text, output the following.
    Context: The part of the input that contains the value of "augmented passage" 
    Problem: The part of the input that occurs after "question:"
    Relevant variables: The part of the input that occurs before "augmented passage"
    Irrelevant variables: The part of the output containing value of "new variables". If this is not present in the input, do not include this key in the output.
    Explanation: An explanation of why the irrelevant variables are not related to the problem. If irrelevant (new) variables are not in the input, do not include this key in the output
    Solution: The part of the input containing the "Solution Steps" string.

    Example:
    Input: 'Number of pencils (changes from 2 to 3)', 'Augmented: There are 2 pencils in the drawer with a weight of 10 grams each. Tim placed 3 pencils, each weighing 12 grams, in the drawer. Now the pencils in the drawer have a total weight of 56 grams.', 'New Variables: Weight (changes from 10 to 12)']]. Question: What is the total number of pencils? Solution steps: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5
    Output: 
    Context: There are 2 pencils in the drawer with a weight of 10 grams each. Tim placed 3 pencils, each weighing 12 grams, in the drawer. Now there are 5 pencils in the drawer with a total weight of 58 grams.
    Problem: What is the total number of pencils?
    Relevant Variables: Number of pencils (changes from 2 to 5)
    Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 10 to 12)
    Explanation: As the problem deals with number of pencils, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pencils when counting the total quantity.
    Solution: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5
