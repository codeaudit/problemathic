He has saved $6 from his allowance, and his uncle gave him $13<<Question>> How much more money does Dalton need to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball?", "completion": "<<Explanation>>First, we need to find out how much Dalton needs in total to buy all the items. The jump rope costs $7, the board game costs $12, and the playground ball costs $4. So, the total cost of all items is $7 + $12 + $4 = $23. Dalton has saved $6 from his allowance and his uncle gave him $13. So, the total amount Dalton has is $6 + $13 = $19. To find out how much more money Dalton needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the total cost of the items. So, $23 - $19 = $4. Therefore, Dalton needs $4 more to buy the jump rope, the game, and the ball.<<FinalAnswer>>4.0"}

", "completion": "<<Explanation>>In order to find the total number of loads Wendy would have to do, we first add the number of shirts (39) and sweaters (33) to get a total of 72 pieces of clothing. Since Wendy's washing machine can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time, we divide the total number of pieces of clothing (72) by the capacity of the washing machine (8). This gives us 9 loads with some pieces of clothing left over, but since we can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9.<<FinalAnswer>>9.0"}

", "completion": "<<Explanation>>First, we need to find out how much each person spent. Tom bought 3 decks, and since each deck costs 8 dollars, Tom spent 3 * 8 = 24 dollars. His friend bought 5 decks, so his friend spent 5 * 8 = 40 dollars. To find out the total amount spent, we add the amount Tom spent and the amount his friend spent.

Since the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, the next two numbers will be 'n+2' and 'n+4'. According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 69. So, we can form the equation: n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 69. Simplifying this equation, we get 3n + 6 = 69. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us 3n = 63. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find n = 21.
