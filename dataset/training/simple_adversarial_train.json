{"dataset": "problemathic_adv_simple", "id": "passage_1345", "prompt": "<<Passage>>Sandy, who weighs 200 pounds, has 8 dozen books. Fred, who weighs 500 pounds, has 5 times more books than Sandy.<<Question>> How many books does Fred have ?", "completion": "<<Reasoning>>The problem deals with the number of books, so the weight of Sandy and Fred is irrelevant. We first need to convert the number of dozens of books Sandy has into a single count. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we multiply 8 (dozens) by 12 to get 96 books. Then, since Fred has 5 times more books than Sandy, we multiply Sandy's total number of books (96) by 5.<<RelevantVariables>>Number of books (Changes from 8 dozen to 480)<<Explanation>>First, convert the number of dozens of books Sandy has into a single count. 1 dozen equals 12, so 8 dozens equals 8*12 = 96 books. Fred has 5 times more books than Sandy, so Fred has 96*5 = 480 books.<<FinalAnswer>>480.0"}
