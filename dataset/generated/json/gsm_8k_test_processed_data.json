This is done by adding the cost of the house ($80,000) and the cost of the repairs ($50,000), which equals $130,000. Then, we calculate the value of the house after the repairs. Since the value of the house increased by 150%, this means the value of the house after the repairs is 150% of the original cost of the house, which is $80,000. So, 150% of $80,000 is $120,000. Therefore, the value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 (original cost) + $120,000 (increase in value) = $200,000. The profit made is the value of the house after the repairs minus the total cost of the house and the repairs. So, $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.",

To recover the initial cost of planting the tree ($90), he would need to earn $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

        "solution": "First, we need to find out Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age when Raymond had his son from his current age.

We know that Marie paid a total of $50, so we subtract the $33 from $50 to find out how much was spent on pizza. This gives us $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8, we divide $17 by $8 to find out how many boxes of pizza were ordered. The result is 2.125, but since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we round down to 2.

Therefore, the number of gold coins would be 'x + 30'. The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, so we can write the equation as x + (x + 30) = 110. Solving this equation, we get 2x + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of silver coins is 40.

        "solution": "Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. It is given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's assume the number of silver coins as 'x'. Therefore, the number of gold coins would be 'x + 30'. The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, so we can write the equation as x + (x + 30) = 110. Solving this equation, we get 2x + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.",

        "explanation": "First, we need to determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of the beeswax and wicks for 2 pounds is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00. Next, we find out how much Charlie earns from selling 20 candles. Since each candle is sold for $2.00, he earns 20 * $2.00 = $40.00. Finally, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the earnings to find the net profit. So, $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.",

        "passage": "Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.",
        "explanation": "First, we need to find the cost per flower in each package. For the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50/3 = $0.83. For the package of 2 flowers at $1, the cost per flower is $1/2 = $0.50. Therefore, the package of 2 flowers is cheaper. If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages, which will cost him 9*$1 = $9. If he bought the same number of flowers in packages of 3, it would cost him 6*$2.50 = $15. Therefore, by buying the flowers in packages of 2, he saves $15 - $9 = $6.",

Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate 3*14 = 42 roll-ups. To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we add the number of roll-ups each person ate and divide by the number of people. So, (48+42)/2 = 45 roll-ups.",

For each client, Kim needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, costing $2 and $5 respectively. Therefore, the total cost for each client is 2*$2 + $5 = $9. As Kim has 8 clients, his total expenses will be 8*$9 = $72. Kim's total income is $92, so his profit is his income minus his expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.",

Next, we find out how long it takes each of them to get home by dividing their respective distances by their speeds. Steve's time is 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes and Tim's time is 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

        "explanation": "First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. Since the length of the baguette is given in feet, we will convert all lengths to feet. 1 foot is 12 inches, so a roll which is 4 inches long is 4/12 = 0.33 feet long, and a croissant which is 6 inches long is 6/12 = 0.5 feet long. Then, we multiply the length of each type of baked good by the number of that baked good Bill makes. So, the total length of the rolls is 300 * 0.33 = 99 feet, the total length of the croissants is 120 * 0.5 = 60 feet, and the total length of the baguettes is 60 * 2 = 120 feet. Adding these together, we get 99 + 60 + 120 = 279 feet.",

If the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, then the number of girls on the Chinese team would be the total number of Chinese participants minus the number of boys. That is 160 - 60 = 100.

He donates half of this amount to charity, which is 1/2 * 2500$ = 1250$. After the donation, Zaid has 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$ left.

The cost of buying each bag is $20 and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost is $22x. The trader sells each bag at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling the bags is $30x. The trader's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x. We know that the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400. Solving for 'x', we get x = 50. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.",

        "explanation": "First, we need to find out how much money Sara needs in total. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes, that's $20 * 2 = $40. Adding the cost of the jacket, $30 + $40 = $70. This is the total amount of money Sara needs. She already has $10 saved, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more. Each time she babysits, she earns $5. She babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. So, she still needs $60 - $20 = $40. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns each time: $40 / $4 = 10.

        "solution": "First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss in a month. Since he spends 15 minutes every day, and there are 30 days in a month, he spends 15*30 = 450 minutes on calls with his boss. He also has 300 extra minutes of calls. So, the total number of minutes he has used is 450 (boss calls) + 300 (extra calls) = 750 minutes. Since his plan has 1000 minutes, the number of minutes he has left is 1000 (total minutes) - 750 (used minutes) = 250 minutes.",

So, 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes. Therefore, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

Since one-fourth of the remaining students like green, we divide the remaining number of students (40 - 20 = 20) by 4, which gives us 5. This means 5 students like green. Finally, we find out how many students like yellow. Since the rest of the students like yellow, we subtract the number of students who like blue and green from the total number of students.

        "solution": "First, calculate the distance traveled in the first four days by multiplying the daily distance (200 kilometers) by the number of days (4). This gives us 800 kilometers. Next, calculate the distance traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 240 kilometers. On the seventh day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance is 0 kilometers. During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, which totals to 2100 kilometers. Add up all these distances to get the total distance traveled: 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 0 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.",

Since a year has 12 months and we've already accounted for 14 months (6 + 8), there are 10 months left in the first year and another 12 months in the second year, so 22 months * $14/month = $308.

The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel.",
        "explanation": "First, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since her drive is four times as long as Wayne's, and Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, we multiply 4 by 4 to get 16 minutes. Then, since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we add these 5 minutes to the 16 minutes it takes her to drive to the theater. 16 plus 5 equals 21. So, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes before the movie starts. But the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. So we subtract Wayne's 4-minute drive from Bernadette's 21-minute drive, which gives us 17 minutes. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.",

The rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31, were sold at $25 each, giving us 31 * $25 = $775. So, the total amount he earned from selling the sneakers is $340 + $775 = $1115. The salesman originally bought the sneakers for $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings, so $1115 - $576 = $539.",

Then, since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes (48) by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold (12) to find out how many pans she needs. 48 divided by 12 equals 4. Therefore, Mary needs to bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all her sprinkles.",

        "passage": "9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64\" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60\" tall.",
        "explanation": "To find the height of the human pyramid, we first need to convert the height of the cheerleaders from inches to feet. 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 64 inches is equal to 64/12 = 5.33 feet and 60 inches is equal to 60/12 = 5 feet. The pyramid is built with 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on top of them, 2 girls on top of the 3 and the shortest girl at the top. So, the height of the pyramid is the sum of the height of the girls in each level. Since all the girls except the top one are of the same height, we can multiply their height by the number of levels (4). So, the total height is 5.33*4 + 5 = 21.32 feet. Since we usually round off to the nearest whole number, the height of the pyramid is approximately 21 feet.",

The cost of the first venue is $200 plus $5 per person. So, the equation for the first venue is 200 + 5x, where x is the number of guests. The cost of the second venue is $25 per person, so the equation for the second venue is 25x. Setting these two equations equal to each other gives us 200 + 5x = 25x. Solving for x, we subtract 5x from both sides to get 200 = 20x. Finally, we divide both sides by 20 to get x = 10. So, the two venues will cost the same if there are 10 guests.",

To find out how long he takes to swim 3 miles, we multiply this time by 3, which gives us 102 minutes. On a cold day, Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile, so for 3 miles, he would take 48 minutes.

        "explanation": "First, we need to find out how many roses Ford needs to supply to all the flower shops every week. We do this by adding the number of roses ordered by each shop: 20 (from the first shop) + 15 (from the second shop) + 30 (from the third shop) = 65 roses per week. Since there are roughly 4 weeks in a month, Ford needs to supply 65 roses * 4 weeks = 260 roses every month. However, Ford only grows 40 roses every week, which means he grows 40 roses * 4 weeks = 160 roses every month. To find out how many roses Ford lacks every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses he needs to supply: 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses.

        "explanation": "Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as x. According to the problem, there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, which means there are 0.99x red jelly beans. Similarly, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, which means there are 1.01x green jelly beans. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500. Solving this equation gives us x = 1500. Therefore, there are 1500 blue jelly beans, 1485 red jelly beans (0.99*1500), and 1515 green jelly beans (1.01*1500).

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours which is 54 miles (12 * 4.5). Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours which is 25 miles (10 * 2.5). Adding these together, 54 miles and 25 miles, gives a total of 79 miles.",

        "solution": "Rong saves 20 coins every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins. In ten years, Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong, which is 20 * 2/5 = 8 more coins per month. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. In ten years, Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins. Together, Rong and Neil save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins in ten years.",

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city (120) to the fireworks she's setting off in her backyard (15) to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, which is 135.",

This is done by multiplying the cost per pound ($1.5) by the number of pounds picked (30), and then adding the cost to go picking ($20). This gives a total cost of $65. Next, calculate how much it would have cost to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. This is done by multiplying the store price per pound ($2) by the number of pounds picked (30), giving a total cost of $60.

        "explanation": "First, we find out how many slices of pizza were initially there. Since each person ordered a pizza with 12 slices and there were 5 people, there were initially 5*12 = 60 slices of pizza. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each of their pizzas had 12 slices, each of them ate 2/3*12 = 8 slices. So, the three of them together ate 3*8 = 24 slices. The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So each of them ate 3/4*12 = 9 slices. So, the two of them together ate 2*9 = 18 slices. So in total, they ate 24+18 = 42 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is the initial number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is 60-42 = 18 slices.",

Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 100 inches for the length of Topher's shoe. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes. So, we can set up the equation 100 = 9B + 10, where B is the length of Bobby's shoe. Solving for B, we subtract 10 from both sides to get 90 = 9B, and then divide both sides by 9 to get B = 10.

        "explanation": "First, we need to calculate the time spent driving. We know that the total time spent was 6 hours, and 1.5 hours were spent hiking, so 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours were spent driving. Next, we calculate the distance driven by multiplying the time spent driving by the speed of driving. So, 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour = 225 miles. Then, we calculate the speed of hiking, which is 5 miles per hour less than half the speed of driving. So, (50/2) - 5 = 20 miles/hour. Finally, we calculate the distance hiked by multiplying the time spent hiking by the speed of hiking. So, 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles. The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked, so 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.",

Adding these together, she has 14 stuffed animals. If she wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we need to find out what number is 30% of 14. To do this, we multiply 14 by 0.30 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). This gives us 4.2. Since she can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 5. However, if she buys 5 stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals becomes 19 and the percentage of goats becomes 26.3% which is less than 30%. So, she needs to buy one more goat.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341. Simplifying this gives 7x + 12 = 341. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 7x = 329. Dividing both sides by 7 gives x = 47. So, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.",

        "solution": "To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. Since each student was given ten burritos and there were 50 students, a total of 50*10 = 500 burritos were eaten by the students. Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520. Since George ordered 600 burritos, the number of leftover burritos is 600 (ordered) - 520 (eaten) = 80.",

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get Sofie = Fawn - 12 + 25, or Fawn = Sofie - 13. Adding the number of books each person has, we get Sofie + Anne + Fawn = 85, or Sofie + (Sofie - 25) + (Sofie - 13) = 85. Simplifying, we get 3Sofie = 123, or Sofie = 41.

Since 4 small masks require 2 yards of material, one small mask would require 2/4 = 0.5 yard of material. Similarly, since 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material, one large mask would require 2.25/3 = 0.75 yard of material. Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we multiply the number of masks by the material needed for one mask. So, 20 small masks would require 20*0.5 = 10 yards of material and 8 large masks would require 8*0.75 = 6 yards of material. Adding these two amounts together, we get 10+6 = 16 yards of material.",

This gives us 30 * 10 * 0.8 = $240. Next, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops. As the lollipops were bought for $0, the total cost is $0.

        "explanation": "Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex caught as A, S, and X respectively. From the problem, we know that X + S + A = 339, X = S + 5, and S = 4A - 13. We can substitute X and S in the first equation with the expressions from the second and third equations respectively. This gives us (4A - 13) + 5 + A = 339. Simplifying this equation gives us 5A = 347, so A = 69. Substituting A = 69 into the equation S = 4A - 13 gives us S = 4*69 - 13 = 276 - 13 = 263. Therefore, Stan has caught 263 Pokemon.",

        "explanation": "To find the total distance traveled by the bird, we need to calculate the distance for each leg of the journey and then add them together. The distance traveled is the product of the speed and time. For the first leg, the bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so the distance is 10 * 30 = 300 miles. For the second leg, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, so the distance is 2 * 18 = 36 miles. For the third leg, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, so the distance is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds. The total howling time is the sum of the howling times of all three wolves, which is 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the total howling time in minutes is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.",

        "solution": "Firstly, we need to find out the total number of sweets Anne has. Since each pack contains 60 pieces and she has 15 packs, we multiply 60 by 15 to get 900. Anne kept two packs for herself, which is 2 packs times 60 pieces per pack, equaling 120 pieces. We subtract this from the total number of sweets, which is 900 - 120 = 780. Anne then distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend received 780 divided by 10, which is 78 pieces.",

        "explanation": "First, we find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since it's twice as much as with bare hands, it's 2 * 12 = 24 pounds. Then, we find out how much ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since it's 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, it's 24 + 0.5 * 24 = 36 pounds. Now, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a day. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds, it's 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds. Finally, we find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. Since they can mine 1440 pounds in a day, it's 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.",

Since the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, the length of the fabric should be 6 feet (the length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet. Similarly, the width of the fabric should be 8 feet (the width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet. To find the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we multiply the length by the width.

      "question": "How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?",

      "simple": {
        "passage": "Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all.",
        "explanation": "Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. According to the problem, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so we can denote this as x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which we can denote as x/2. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So, we can set up the following equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19. To simplify this equation, we multiply each term by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38. This simplifies to 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us x = 6. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.",

        "explanation": "First, we need to find out how many people in total Kayla invited. This is done by adding the number of her classmates (25), the girls in her dance class (7), and her family members (13), which gives us a total of 45 people. However, 4 people said they couldn't come, so we subtract 4 from 45, leaving us with 41 people who will attend the party. The theater fee covers 20 people, so we need to find out how many additional guests there are by subtracting 20 from 41, which gives us 21 additional guests. Each additional guest costs $6, so we multiply 21 by 6 to find the total cost for the additional guests, which is $126.

The earnings from the BMX bikes are 45 * ($500/2) = $11250, since a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike. The earnings from the MTB bikes are 105 * $500 = $52500.

We also know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Since Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can set up the equation 2Sarah + 12 = 30.

So, the total money earned by Jason is calculated as follows: (6 * $0.50) + (1 * $3.00) + (2 * $0.75) + (1 * $1.50) = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00",

Then, we calculate how many jelly beans can fit in the jar considering the size of a jelly bean (.15 cubic inches) and the packing efficiency (80%). This gives us 540*.80/.15 = 2880 jelly beans. Tim estimates that 30% of these jelly beans are red, so his guess is 2880*.30 = 864 red jelly beans. However, the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900.

We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 8 (the number of hours in a workday) by 60 to get 480 minutes in a workday.

Therefore, he needs 30 customers to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars (15 cars * 2). Furthermore, for every 25 telephone calls he makes, he gets one person to come into the dealership. Therefore, to get 30 people to come into the dealership, he needs to make 750 telephone calls (30 customers * 25 calls per customer).",

Adding these amounts together, we get $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00 weekly. To find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply this weekly amount by 5. So, $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.",

        "explanation": "First, we need to find out how much Mark saved on the radiator. The radiator originally cost $400, but he got it for 80% off. 80% of $400 is $320. So, he paid $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator. Next, we need to calculate how much he paid the mechanic. The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150. To find the total amount Mark paid, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor. $80 + $150 = $230.",
