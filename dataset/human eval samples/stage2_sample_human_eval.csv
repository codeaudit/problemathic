Augmented Passage: Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent to wash a pound of clothes. She also measures the volume of water used to wash the clothes, which starts at 1 liter but increases to 1.5 liters over time.

New Variables: Volume of water (changes from 1 liter to 1.5 liters)

Explanation: The new variable Volume of water is added and is independent of the existing variables. The units for volume of water (liters) are different from the units for amount of detergent (ounces) and weight of clothes (pounds). The augmented passage does not provide any numerical information about the existing variables (amount of detergent and weight of clothes) and only introduces a new variable with its respective values, adhering to the rules.

Question: How many ounces of soap will she use to wash 9 pounds of clothes?

Solution steps: In order to find the total number of ounces of soap used to wash 9 pounds of clothes, we need to find the ratio of ounces of soap used to pounds of clothes and then multiply it by 9 pounds.

The given ratio is 2 ounces of detergent to 1 pound of clothes.

To find the ratio for 9 pounds of clothes, we multiply the ratio by 9:

2 ounces/pound * 9 pounds = 18 ounces

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will use 18 ounces of soap to wash 9 pounds of clothes. FINAL ANSWER: 18

Output:
Context: Mrs. Hilt uses 2 ounces of detergent to wash a pound of clothes. She also measures the volume of water used to wash the clothes, which starts at 1 liter but increases to 1.5 liters over time.
Problem: How many ounces of soap will she use to wash 9 pounds of clothes?

Irrelevant Variables: Number of cats (5), Number of dogs (3), Volume (changes from 1000 to 1500 cubic feet)
Explanation: The irrelevant variables, number of cats and number of dogs, are not related to the problem of finding the cost of bubble gum. Similarly, the variable volume represents the changing volume of air in Sarah's house and is not relevant to the problem. Therefore, these variables are considered irrelevant.
Solution: To find the total cost of 136 pieces of bubble gum, we multiply the number of pieces (136) by the cost per piece (18 cents). Using the formula: Total cost = Number of pieces * Cost per piece, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
Total cost = 136 * 18 = 2448 cents. FINAL ANSWER: The cost of 136 pieces of bubble gum would be 2448 cents.",TRUE,2448,2,
