Context: Michelle began her pizza delivery route with 0.5 of a tank of gas in her car. Along her route, she encountered dense fog, causing the visibility to decrease by 20%. When she made it back to the pizzeria, 0.16666666666666666 of a tank of gas was left.
Problem: How much gas did Michelle use?
Relevant Variables: Tank of gas (changes from 0.5 to 0.16666666666666666)
Irrelevant Variables: None
Explanation: The new variable Visibility is added to the passage, which represents the decrease in visibility due to dense fog. It is independent of the tank of gas variable and not related to any of the existing variables (fuel efficiency) in the passage. The units for visibility (percentage decrease) are different from the units for the tank of gas, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not provide any extra numerical information about the existing variables (tank of gas), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find out how much gas Michelle used on her pizza delivery route, we need to subtract the amount of gas left at the end from the amount of gas she started with. 

Given that Michelle began her route with 0.5 of a tank of gas and ended with 0.16666666666666666 of a tank of gas, we can find the difference by subtracting the final amount from the initial amount.

0.5 - 0.16666666666666666 = 0.3333333333333333

Therefore, Michelle used 0.3333333333333333 of a tank of gas during her pizza delivery route. FINAL ANSWER: 0.3333333333333333",TRUE,0.333333333,2,

Output:
Context: While playing a video game, Paul scored 3103 points. He and his cousin together have a total of 5816 points. Additionally, Paul's accuracy increased from 78% to 85%.
Problem: How many points does Paul's cousin have?
Relevant Variables: Paul's score (3103 points), Total score (5816 points)
Irrelevant Variables: Accuracy (changes from 78% to 85%)
Explanation: The new variable Accuracy is unrelated to the problem as it represents the success rate in the game and does not provide any numerical information about Paul's cousin's points. Therefore, Accuracy is considered irrelevant. The relevant variables, Paul's score and Total score, provide the necessary information to calculate Paul's cousin's points.
Solution: In order to find how many points Paul's cousin has, we subtract Paul's score (3103) from the total score (5816).
Total points - Paul's points = Cousin's points
5816 - 3103 = 2713
Therefore, Paul's cousin has 2713 points.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pencils, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pencils when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5

Context: Sarah had some trucks, but after giving 13 of them to Jeff, she now has 38 remaining.
Problem: How many trucks did Sarah have to start with?
Relevant Variables: Number of trucks (changes from some value to 38)
Explanation: No new variable is added as all the information in the passage is related to the existing variable of the number of trucks.
Solution: In order to find the number of trucks Sarah had to start with, we need to reverse the actions mentioned in the problem.

1. Sarah started with an unknown number of trucks.
2. She gave 13 trucks to Jeff.
3. After giving away the 13 trucks, Sarah is left with 38 trucks.

To find the total number of trucks Sarah had to start with, we need to add the trucks given to Jeff (13) to the trucks left with Sarah (38).

13 + 38 = 51

So, Sarah had 51 trucks to start with. FINAL ANSWER: 51",TRUE,51,4,

Problem: How much taller was Miki's sandcastle than her sister's?

Relevant Variables: Height of Miki's sandcastle (0.8333333333333334 foot) and Height of her sister's sandcastle (0.5 foot)

Irrelevant Variables: Volume of water in the buckets used to build the sandcastles (changes from 2 gallons to 3 gallons)

Explanation: The new variable Volume is added, which represents the volume of water in the buckets used to build the sandcastles. It is independent of the height of the sandcastles variable in the original passage. The units for volume (gallons) are different from the units for height (foot), fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variables (height of sandcastles) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.

Solution: To find the height difference between Miki's and her sister's sandcastles, we subtract the height of her sister's sandcastle (0.5 foot) from the height of Miki's sandcastle (0.8333333333333334 foot).

Problem: How many bottle caps does Anne end with?
Relevant Variables: Number of bottle caps for Anne (changes from 10 to 15)
Irrelevant Variables: Number of bottle caps for Albert (9)
Explanation: The new variable ""Total number of bottle caps for Anne"" is added, which represents the sum of Anne's initial number of bottle caps and the additional 5 she found. The new variable is independent of the existing variable ""Number of bottle caps"". The units for the new variable (count) are not related to the units for the existing variable (count of bottle caps), fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of bottle caps for Albert) that did not exist in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of bottle caps Anne ends with, we need to add her initial number of bottle caps (10) with the number of additional bottle caps she found (5).

Relevant Variables: Percentage of one-bedroom apartments (0.16666666666666666), Percentage of two-bedroom apartments (0.3333333333333333)
Irrelevant Variables:
Explanation: The existing variables, percentage of one-bedroom apartments and percentage of two-bedroom apartments, directly relate to the problem of finding the fraction of apartments that are either one- or two-bedroom. The irrelevant variable, Volume, is added to represent the average volume of each apartment. Since volume is not relevant to finding the fraction of apartments, it is considered irrelevant.
Solution: In order to find the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom, we need to add the fractions of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. The fraction of one-bedroom apartments is 0.16666666666666666 and the fraction of two-bedroom apartments is 0.3333333333333333. To add these fractions, we find a common denominator of 6.
