Explanation: The problem deals with the number of eggs and their price, so there is no need to consider the weight of the ducks. Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. She uses 7 of these eggs (3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins). The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.
Solution: To find out how many eggs she sells at the farmers' market, we subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid. That is, 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. She sells each egg for $2, so to find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg. That is, 9 * 2 = $18.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_3, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sprints (3), distance of each sprint (60 meters), number of times he runs per week (3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total distance James runs in a week, we only need to consider the number of sprints he runs, the distance of each sprint, and the number of times he runs per week. The change in humidity is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: To find the total meters James runs in a week, we multiply the number of sprints he runs each time (3) by the distance of each sprint (60 meters). This gives us 180 meters per session. Since he runs 3 times a week, we then multiply 180 by 3 to get 540 meters in total for the week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_4, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of chickens (20), Number of cups of feed per chicken per day (3), Number of cups of feed given in the morning (15), Number of cups of feed given in the afternoon (25)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. The temperature changes are irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed a day. This means she needs a total of 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed every day. In the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 cups of feed. This means she has already given them 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Therefore, in the final meal of the day, she needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_5, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of glasses (16), Price of glasses ($5, $3)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the glasses Kylar bought. The weight of Kylar is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how many glasses Kylar buys at full price and how many at a discount. Since every second glass is cheaper, half of the glasses (16 / 2 = 8) are bought at full price and the other half at a discount. The full price glasses cost 8 * $5 = $40. The discounted glasses cost 60% of the full price, so they are $5 * 0.6 = $3 each. Therefore, the discounted glasses cost 8 * $3 = $24. Adding these together, the total cost is $40 + $24 = $64.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_6, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse (Changes from unknown to 20, 80, and 160 respectively)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sheep in each city, which we can calculate, there is no need to consider the weight of the sheep when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep. To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse together. So, 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_7, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: File size (200 GB), Download speed (2 GB/minute), Time taken for restart (20 minutes), Percentage of file downloaded before restart (40%)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time taken to download a file. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the solution. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how long it would take Carla to download 40% of the file at a speed of 2 GB/minute. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. So, it would take her 80/2 = 40 minutes to download 40% of the file. Then, Windows forces a restart which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to download the entire file again which takes 200/2 = 100 minutes. So, in total, it would take Carla 40 (initial download) + 20 (restart) + 100 (re-download) = 160 minutes to download the file.

Explanation: As the problem deals with Eliza's earnings, we don't need to consider the temperature of the room. We only need to calculate her regular pay and overtime pay.
Solution: First, calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours by multiplying her hourly rate ($10) by the number of hours (40). This gives us $400. Next, calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours overtime, and her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So, multiply her hourly rate ($10) by 1.2 to get her overtime rate ($12). Then, multiply this by the number of overtime hours (5) to get her overtime pay ($60). Finally, add her regular pay ($400) and her overtime pay ($60) to get her total earnings for the week ($460).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of downloads, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total downloads.
Solution: In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, which is 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads. The total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_13, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of vacuum cleaners (Changes from X to 5)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of vacuum cleaners, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the initial quantity.
Solution: Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X. According to the problem, she first sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is X/3. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house. After these two sales, she had X - X/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had (X - X/3 - 2) / 2 vacuum cleaners left. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation (X - X/3 - 2) / 2 = 5. Solving this equation, we get X = 18. Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the profit the merchant can make from two different purchase plans. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the profit.
        Solution: First, calculate the profit for each purchase plan. For the jewelry, the profit would be 2.5% of $5,000, which is $125. For the electronic gadgets, the profit would be 1.2% of $8,000, which is $96. The merchant would make more profit by purchasing the jewelry, and this profit would be $125.

Explanation: The problem is asking for Jill's annual salary. Her weight is irrelevant to this calculation. We only need to consider her hourly wage for each job, the number of hours she works per week for each job, and the number of weeks she works per year.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Jill earns in a week for each job. For teaching, she earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week, so she earns 20*35 = $700 per week. For cheerleading, she earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week, so she earns 30*15 = $450 per week. So in total, she earns 700+450 = $1150 per week. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is 1150*50 = $57500.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_18, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of eggs eaten daily (Constant at 3), Number of weeks (Constant at 4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of eggs eaten, which we already have, there is no need to consider Claire's weight when calculating the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks.
Solution: Claire eats 3 eggs every day. In a week, which has 7 days, she will eat 3*7 = 21 eggs. In 4 weeks, she will eat 21*4 = 84 eggs. Since a dozen contains 12 eggs, the number of dozens she will eat is 84/12 = 7 dozens.

Explanation: The problem deals with the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance of the trail to achieve her desired average speed. The temperature changes are irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Marissa has already walked 6 miles in 2 hours, which is an average speed of 3 miles per hour. She has 6 miles left to walk. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1.5 hours. This means she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per 1.5 hours, which is 4 miles per hour.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of Raymond and Samantha, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating the years ago Raymond's son was born.
Solution: First, we need to find out Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract the age when Raymond had his son from his current age. So, 37 - 23 = 14 years ago, Raymond's son was born.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the original price of the book, the weight of the book is irrelevant. We only need to consider the discounted price and the discount rate.
Solution: To find the original price of the book, we divide the discounted price by the percentage of the original price that it represents. In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and it represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% discount). So, we divide $19.50 by 0.75 to get the original price. $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of ice cream Cynthia will spend in 60 days. Her weight change is irrelevant to the calculation. She eats one serving of ice cream every night, and there are 15 servings in a carton. So, for 60 days, she will need 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00.
Solution: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. So, for 60 days, she will need 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons will be 4 * $4.00 = $16.00.

        Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the boots, which is related to the cost of the heels, there is no need to consider Gloria's weight when calculating the cost.
        Solution: To find the cost of the boots, we first need to find the cost of the two pairs of heels. One pair of heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. The boots cost five dollars more than the two pairs of heels, so the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_31, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of jelly beans each friend guessed (Changes from 80 to 60 to 100)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the average guess of the number of jelly beans, the humidity in the room is irrelevant and does not affect the calculation. 
Solution: First, we find out the number of jelly beans each friend guessed. The first friend guessed 80. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, which is 20 + (1/2)*80 = 60. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess, which is 80 + 0.25*80 = 100. To find the average, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses. So, (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time John spends taking care of dogs. The weight of the dogs is irrelevant to the time spent, so we can ignore that variable.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total hours John spends each day taking care of the dogs. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours to walk and take care of, and John has 10 dogs, we multiply 0.5 by 10 to get 5 hours per day. Then, to find out how many hours he spends per week, we multiply the daily hours (5) by the number of days in a week (7). So, 5 hours per day times 7 days equals 35 hours per week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_35, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Points scored (Changes from 4 to 9)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total points scored by Mike, so the humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4, which is 1. So, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes. To find the total points he scored, we add the points he scored in the first and second 20 minutes. So, 4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 points in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_38, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance run (60 miles), Time run (6 hours)
Explanation: The problem is asking for John's speed, which is calculated by dividing the distance he runs by the time it takes him. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to determine the total hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours each for the next two days. In total, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in a week. Since he runs 60 miles in these 6 hours, his speed is 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_39, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Speed of skipping, running, and walking; Time spent running and walking
Explanation: The problem deals with the distance Dana can cover while running and walking. The temperature changes are irrelevant to the calculation of the total distance covered.
Solution: First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her running speed is twice that, so she runs at 6 miles per hour. Her walking speed is a quarter of her running speed, so she walks at 1.5 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of the time running, that's two hours, during which she can cover 12 miles (6 miles per hour * 2 hours). If she spends two-thirds of the time walking, that's four hours, during which she can cover 6 miles (1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours). Adding these distances together gives us a total of 18 miles.

Explanation: The problem deals with the age of the iPhones, so the humidity in the room is irrelevant. We start by finding the age of Ben's iPhone, which is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old (1*2). Then, we find the age of Brandon's iPhone, which is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old (2*4).
Solution: First, we find the age of Ben's iPhone which is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old (1*2). Then, we find the age of Brandon's iPhone which is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old (2*4).

Explanation: The problem deals with the distance Polly can throw the javelin and the reach of the dragon's flames. The temperature change is irrelevant to the problem. 
Solution: Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, the distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet. The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. So, the distance outside of the reach of the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pie pieces, so we don't need to consider the humidity in the room. We first calculate the total number of pieces Grandma Jones initially had by multiplying the number of pies she baked by the number of pieces per pie. Then, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from this total to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests.
Solution: Grandma Jones initially had 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of post-it notes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the purse when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to add the number of Post-it notes she started with (80) to the number she had left at the end (23), then subtract this total from the number of Post-it notes she placed on the cups of coffee (220). So, 80 + 23 = 103. Then, 220 - 103 = 117. However, this is incorrect. The correct calculation should be 220 + 23 - 80 = 163. This means that the package of Post-it notes Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_47, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of blue ties, cost of blue ties, number of red ties, cost of red ties
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of ties John bought. The weight of John is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost of ties. 
Solution: First, we find out how many blue ties John bought. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2*5 = 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so each red tie costs 40*1.5 = $60. Therefore, John spent 60*10 = $600 on red ties. Adding the amount he spent on blue and red ties, we get 200+600 = $800.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_48, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of wire (Changes from 4 feet to 48 inches), Length of each piece (6 inches)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pieces obtained from the wire, the weight of the wire is irrelevant. We need to focus on the length of the wire and the length of each piece. 
Solution: To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches since the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 4-foot wire is 4*12 = 48 inches long. Then, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. So, 48 inches divided by 6 inches equals 8 pieces.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_49, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of floors (15), Number of units per floor (8), Fraction of building occupied (3/4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of unoccupied units, which we can find by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units, there is no need to consider the humidity in the building when calculating the total number of unoccupied units.
Solution: First, we find the total number of units in the building by multiplying the number of floors (15) by the number of units per floor (8). This gives us 120 units. Then, we find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units (120) by the fraction of the building that is occupied (3/4). This gives us 90 occupied units. Finally, we find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units (90) from the total number of units (120). This gives us 30 unoccupied units.

Explanation: The problem involves calculating the total earnings from selling eggs in a week. Therefore, the humidity level, which changes from 50% to 70%, is not relevant in this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs are produced per day. Since a dozen contains 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day (252) by 12. This gives us 21 dozens. Next, we find out how much Lloyd makes per day by multiplying the number of dozens (21) by the price per dozen ($2). This gives us $42 per day. To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings ($42) by the number of days in a week (7). This gives us $294.

Explanation: As the problem deals with time of travel, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature change when calculating the time taken to travel back.
Solution: First, we need to find out how far Tom traveled. We know that he sailed from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. Given that his speed was 10 miles per hour, we multiply the time by the speed to find the distance. So, 3 hours * 10 miles/hour = 30 miles. Now, we know that he travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back, we divide the distance by the speed. So, 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the weight of items Uriah needs to remove from his bag, not the volume of the bag. Therefore, the volume of the bag is irrelevant to the solution. 
        Solution: Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 of them, which totals to 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. He still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 / 1/2 = 15.

Explanation: The problem deals with the weight limit of the bridge and the weight of the boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. The speed of the truck is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much weight the bridge can still carry after the truck and driver have crossed it. This is done by subtracting the combined weight of the truck and driver (3755 pounds) from the total weight the bridge can carry (5000 pounds). The result is 1245 pounds. Next, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding this weight. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight (1245 pounds) by the weight of each box (15 pounds). The result is 83. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

Explanation: As the problem deals with Marcy's pension, which is affected by the number of years she works and the percentage of the pension she is entitled to, there is no need to consider her weight when calculating her annual pension.
Solution: Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. If she quits after 30 years, she would have been entitled to this 5% for 10 years. So, we calculate 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. Since she's entitled to this for 10 years, we multiply $2,500 by 10, which gives us $25,000. Therefore, her annual pension will be $25,000.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_64, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Miles driven (100 miles), Gas used (4 gallons), Tank capacity (12 gallons)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, the temperature inside the car is irrelevant. We need to find out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. 
Solution: We know that she drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas, so she can drive 100/4 = 25 miles per gallon. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, she can therefore drive 25 * 12 = 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_65, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time spent on TV and reading (Changes from 2 hours to 3 hours per day, and from 3 days to 12 days in 4 weeks)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time spent on TV and reading, we don't need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the total time. 
Solution: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading (which is half the time he spends watching TV) each day he does this. So in total, he spends 3 hours per day on these activities. He does this 3 times a week, so he spends 3*3 = 9 hours per week. Over 4 weeks, he therefore spends 4*9 = 36 hours on TV and reading.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of people sent by all the schools. Therefore, the volume of the gymnasium is irrelevant to the solution. 
Solution: Each school has sent 2 teams of 5 players each, which makes 10 people per school. As there are 4 schools, that makes 4*10 = 40 people. Additionally, each school has sent 2 coaches, one for each team. That makes 2*4 = 8 coaches. Adding the number of players and coaches gives us 40 + 8 = 48 people in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_67, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of diamonds (175), rubies (140), and emeralds (280)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of gems, so the weight of the chest is irrelevant. We know there are 175 diamonds. The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds, so we subtract 35 from 175 to get 140 rubies. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we multiply 140 by 2 to get 280 emeralds.
Solution: To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_68, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of girls (60), ratio of boys to girls (2:1), student to teacher ratio (5:1)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of teachers, which is dependent on the total number of students, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of teachers. 
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of students at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there are 60 * 2 = 120 boys. Adding the number of boys and girls together, we get 120 + 60 = 180 students. Since there are 5 students for every teacher, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher to find the total number of teachers. So, 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_70, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of classes taught (Changes from 5 to 33), Number of students per class (Constant at 15), Charge per student (Constant at $15)
        Explanation: The problem is asking for the total amount of money Judy makes in a week. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of this total. We only need to consider the number of classes she teaches, the number of students in each class, and the amount she charges per student.
        Solution: Judy teaches 5 classes from Monday to Friday, which makes 5 classes * 5 days = 25 classes. On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. So, in total, she teaches 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes in a week. Each class has 15 students, so she teaches 33 classes * 15 students = 495 students in a week. She charges $15 per student, so she makes 495 students * $15 = $7425 in a week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_71, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of instructions (First recipe has 20, second recipe has twice as many)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of instructions, Kelian's weight is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of instructions in each recipe.
Solution: Kelian has two recipes. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20*2 = 40 instructions. To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we add the number of instructions in the first recipe (20) and the second recipe (40). So, 20 + 40 = 60.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Tommy raises, which is calculated by multiplying the number of items sold by their respective prices. The weight of Tommy is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total money raised from selling brownies. Tommy sold 43 brownies at $3 each, so he raised 43 * 3 = $129 from brownies. Next, we calculate the total money raised from selling cheesecakes. Tommy sold 23 cheesecakes at $4 each, so he raised 23 * 4 = $92 from cheesecakes. To find the total money raised, we add the money raised from brownies and cheesecakes together. $129 + $92 = $221.

Explanation: The problem deals with the calculation of the monthly payment for the cell phones. The weight of the cell phones and accessories is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest, which is 5 cell phones times $150 each, giving us $750. Then, we calculate the interest by multiplying the total cost ($750) by the interest rate (2%), giving us $15. We add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid, which is $765. Since this amount is to be paid over 3 months, we divide the total amount ($765) by 3 to get the monthly payment, which is $255.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_74, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number and price of marigolds, petunias, and begonias (Changes in number of pots sold and prices after rounding)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total money Artie will make, we need to consider the number of pots sold and their respective prices. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of total earnings.
Solution: Artie sells marigolds for $3 per pot (rounded from $2.74), petunias for $2 per pot (rounded from $1.87) and begonias for $2 per pot (rounded from $2.12). If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, he will make 12 * 3 = $36. If he sells 9 pots of petunias, he will make 9 * 2 = $18. If he sells 17 pots of begonias, he will make 17 * 2 = $34. To find out how much he will make in total, we add the amounts together: 36 + 18 + 34 = $88.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_75, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Levels of sandcastle (4 levels), Square footage of top level (16 square feet)
Explanation: The problem is about finding the average square footage of a level in a sandcastle. The humidity at the beach is irrelevant to this calculation. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has 16 square feet. 
Solution: To find the total square footage, we calculate the square footage of each level. The second level will have 16 * 2 = 32 square feet, the third level will have 32 * 2 = 64 square feet, and the fourth level will have 64 * 2 = 128 square feet. Adding all these together, we get a total of 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet. To find the average, we divide this total by the number of levels, which is 4. So, 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_78, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of flowers (18), cost of package of 3 flowers ($2.50), cost of package of 2 flowers ($1)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of flowers, we need to find the cost per flower for each package. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the cost of the flowers.
Solution: First, we need to find the cost per flower in each package. For the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50/3 = $0.83. For the package of 2 flowers at $1, the cost per flower is $1/2 = $0.50. Therefore, the package of 2 flowers is cheaper. If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he will need 9 packages, which will cost him 9*$1 = $9. If he bought the same number of flowers in packages of 3, it would cost him 6*$2.50 = $15. Therefore, by buying the flowers in packages of 2, he saves $15 - $9 = $6.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_80, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of water (Changes from 24 liters to 10 liters)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the water when calculating the remaining quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how much water the two girls got in total. Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, which is 24/6 = 4 liters. So two girls got 4*2 = 8 liters. Then we know a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water that was taken is 8 (girls) + 6 (boy) = 14 liters. The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is 24 (total) - 14 (taken) = 10 liters.

Solution: Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He then bought 21 more, bringing his total to 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. On his birthday, he received 23 more stickers, increasing his total to 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. Charlie then gave 9 stickers to his sister, reducing his total to 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the combined weight of Grace and Alex, the temperature of the room is irrelevant. We need to calculate Alex's weight first, which is 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, and then add it to Grace's weight to get their combined weight.
Solution: Grace weighs 125 pounds. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, 4 times Grace's weight is 500 pounds. Subtracting 2 pounds from this gives us 498 pounds, which is Alex's weight. To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight (125 pounds) to Alex's weight (498 pounds). This gives us a total of 623 pounds.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of games won, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of games won.
Solution: To find the number of games the team won, we first need to know how many games they lost. Since we know they played 22 games in total and won 8 more than they lost, we can set up the equation 22 = x + (x + 8), where x represents the number of games lost. Solving for x gives us x = 7. This means the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

Explanation: The problem deals with the calculation of future salary based on the current salary and the rate of increase. The humidity in the company is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: 
Step 1: Calculate the annual salary. Since Sylvie is paid $600 per month, her annual salary would be $600 * 12 = $7200.
Step 2: Calculate the increase in salary for the next three years. The formula for calculating the salary increase is Initial Salary * (1 + Rate of Increase)^Number of Years. 
So, the salary after three years would be $7200 * (1 + 10/100)^3 = $9360.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of copies sold by Marilyn and Harald. The weight of the records is irrelevant to the solution. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, we can set up the equation H + 10H = 88,000 to find the number of copies Harald sold.
Solution: Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so we can denote Marilyn's sales as 10H. The problem states that they sold 88,000 copies combined, so we can set up the equation H + 10H = 88,000. Solving this equation gives us H = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic. The initial and final weight of the potato salad that Ted prepared is irrelevant to the calculation of the total amount of potato salad needed. 
Solution: First, we calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, 20 adults will eat 20*10 = 200 lbs of potato salad. Next, we calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child will eat 10/2 = 5 lbs of potato salad. Therefore, 5 children will eat 5*5 = 25 lbs of potato salad. Adding these two amounts together, we find that Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_91, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pets (Changes for Cindy, Marcia, and Jan)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pets, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the house when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Next, we find out how many pets Jan has. Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has. So, 4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28 pets in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_92, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Ages of James, Corey, Amy, and Jackson
Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Emily's kids. Emily's weight, which changes from 60 pounds to 80 pounds, is irrelevant to the question asked. 
Solution: From the problem, we know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means Corey is 11 years old. We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, which makes Amy 9 years old. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we subtract 5 from Amy's age to find Jackson's age. So, 9 - 5 equals 4. Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_93, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Lee's time (38 seconds), Gerald's old time (40 seconds), Gerald's speed improvement (10%)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to run the 400-meter hurdles, we only need to consider the times and speed improvement. The changes in humidity are irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald used to run it 2 seconds slower than Lee, which means Gerald used to run it in 40 seconds. However, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast Gerald runs now, we need to subtract 10% from his old time. 10% of 40 seconds is 4 seconds. So, Gerald now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_94, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of dogs (60), ratio of cats to dogs (2:1), number of rabbits (12 less than combined number of dogs and cats)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of pets, which includes dogs, cats, and rabbits, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find the total number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. This gives us 60 * 2 = 120 cats. The total number of dogs and cats is therefore 60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets. Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits. The total number of pets in the neighborhood is therefore 180 dogs and cats + 168 rabbits = 348 pets.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_95, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of students (200), Ratio of boys (2/5), Ratio of girls in girl scout (2/3)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of students, the ratio of boys, and the ratio of girls in the girl scout. The humidity level in the classroom is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: 
Step 1: Find the number of boys in Grade 5 by multiplying the total number of students (200) by 2/5. This gives us 80 boys.
Step 2: Since the rest of the students are girls, subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to find the number of girls: 200 - 80 = 120 girls.
Step 3: Then, find the number of girls in the girl scout by multiplying the total number of girls (120) by 2/3. This gives us 80 girls in the girl scout.
Step 4: Finally, subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout: 120 - 80 = 40 girls.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_96, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours of sleep (Changes from 9 hours for Harry to 6 hours for James)
Explanation: The problem revolves around the hours of sleep, so the changes in humidity are not relevant in this context. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we multiply 2/3 by 9 to get 6 hours. Then, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept. So, 9 - 6 = 3.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_97, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Volume of sauce (Changes from 64 ounces to 32 ounces), Number of tomatoes per can (Constant at 3), Number of cans (Calculated to be 4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tomatoes used, which can be determined by the volume of sauce produced and the number of tomatoes per can. The weight of the tomatoes before and after cooking is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since the canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, this means she started with 64 ounces of canned tomatoes. Each 16 ounce can contains three tomatoes, so to find out how many tomatoes she used, we divide the total ounces of canned tomatoes by the ounces per can and then multiply by the number of tomatoes per can. So, 64 divided by 16 equals 4 cans. 4 cans times 3 tomatoes per can equals 12 tomatoes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cars, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In order to find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes and the number of cars that took an exit from the original number of cars. So, 30 (original number of cars) - 20 (cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes) - 5 (cars that took an exit) = 5. Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of potted plants, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the room when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home, which totals to 2*40 = 80 plants. She also received 18 new potted plants, bringing her total to 80 + 18 = 98 plants. She then decides to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge, which is 1*40 = 40 plants. So, the number of plants she will be left with is 98 - 40 = 58 plants.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_100, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of doorbell rings (Changes based on each friend)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of doorbell rings, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of doorbell rings.
Solution: First, we find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. Since the second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend, we calculate 1/4 of 20 which is 5. Adding this to 20 gives us 25. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so since the fourth friend pressed 60 times, the third friend pressed 70 times. Adding all these together (20 from the first friend, 25 from the second friend, 70 from the third friend, and 60 from the fourth friend) gives us a total of 175 doorbell rings.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_101, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pages to read (Changes from 39 to 24), Number of days left (4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pages Solo has to read and the number of days he has left to read them. His weight is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pages Solo has left to read. He has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. This totals to 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages. Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read. Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. Therefore, to find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the total number of pages left (24) by the number of days left (4). So, 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_102, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of glasses of water (Changes from weekday to weekend)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of glasses of water John drinks, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when counting the total quantity.
Solution: John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, dinner and before bed. This means he drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday. So, for 5 weekdays, he drinks 4*5 = 20 glasses of water. On the weekends, he only drinks water with breakfast, lunch and before bed, which is 3 glasses of water per day. So, for 2 weekend days, he drinks 3*2 = 6 glasses of water. Adding these together, John drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_103, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance of the city (42 miles), Speed of fog (3 miles per 10 minutes)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it will take for the fog to cover the city, we need to consider the distance of the city and the speed of the fog. The humidity level is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: To find out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are there in 42 miles. We do this by dividing 42 by 3, which gives us 14. This means there are 14 3-mile segments in 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply 14 by 10 to get the total time. 14 times 10 equals 140. So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_105, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody (Amir eats 5, Cody eats 3 times as much)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Therefore, the weight of Cody before and after eating is irrelevant to the problem. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies. To find out how many cookies both of them eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats (5) and the number of cookies Cody eats (15). So, 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total inner volume of all 3 boxes. The weight of the boxes is irrelevant to this calculation. We first need to determine the inner dimensions of the box by subtracting twice the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Then we can calculate the volume of one box and multiply by the total number of boxes to find the total inner volume.
Solution: The inner dimensions of the box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches (5-2 by 6-2 by 4-2). The volume of one box is 3*4*2 = 24 cubic inches. Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 3*24 = 72 cubic inches.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_108, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies (Changes from 0 to 110)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cookies baked, so the weight of the cookies is not relevant. We need to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, which can be calculated by considering the number of cookies he baked this year, the number he dropped, and the number he baked more than he planned.
Solution: Henry baked 110 cookies this year, but he dropped 5, so he initially had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies. He baked 15 more cookies than he planned, so he initially planned to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Since he wanted to bake twice as many cookies as last year, that means last year he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of gas and cashback, there is no need to consider the temperature at the gas station when calculating the final cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the gas without any cashback. This is done by multiplying the cost per gallon ($3.00) by the number of gallons purchased (10). This gives us $30.00. Next, we calculate the total cashback. This is done by multiplying the cashback per gallon ($.20) by the number of gallons purchased (10). This gives us $2.00. Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas to find the final cost. $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the average number of roll-ups they ate. The weight of the pile of roll-ups is irrelevant to this calculation. We only need to consider the number of roll-ups each person ate.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many roll-ups each person ate. Beatrice's roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she ate 2*24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell's roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate 3*14 = 42 roll-ups. To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we add the number of roll-ups each person ate and divide by the number of people. So, (48+42)/2 = 45 roll-ups.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_111, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of water taken on per second (0.25 liters), Time to reach shore (64 seconds)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water taken on by the boat, the humidity is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the rate at which the boat is taking on water and the time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
Solution: First, we calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows, and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate that the boat takes on (2 liters/10 feet) * (20 feet/16 seconds) = 0.25 liters per second. Then, since the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate that the boat will have taken on 0.25 liters per second * 64 seconds = 16 liters of water by the time Julia reaches shore.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_112, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of teachers (4), Lessons per teacher (2), Times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson (3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we don't need to consider the volume of the classroom. We only need to consider the number of teachers, the number of lessons each teacher has, and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.
Solution: To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we first need to find the total number of lessons in a day. Since each of the 4 teachers has 2 lessons per day, there are 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons in a day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, it is cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 times in a day.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of photographs and ducks, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone. So, we divide 1800 by 6 to find out the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, which is 300. Then, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we divide 300 by 50 to find out the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, which is 6.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_115, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of lumber (Changes from $180 to $270 after a 50% increase)
Explanation: The problem deals with the profit Sasha can make from selling her leftover lumber. The weight of the lumber is irrelevant to the calculation of profit. The cost of the lumber and the increase in price are the relevant variables.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Sasha spent on the lumber. She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each, which equals $100. She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each, which equals $80. So, she spent a total of $180 on lumber. Since the price of lumber has gone up by 50%, she can sell the lumber for 1.5 times the price she bought it for. So, she can sell it for $180 * 1.5 = $270. The profit she makes is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_117, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of shoes (Changes from 2 to 6), Cost of shoes (Constant at $60)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost, we need to consider the number of shoes bought and their cost. The weight of the shoes, even though it changes, is irrelevant to the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of shoes John bought. Since he bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, he bought 2*3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is 6*$60 = $360.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_119, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Adrien's salary (Changes from $40000 to $56000), Lylah's salary (Changes from $30769.23 to $43076.92)
Explanation: The problem deals with the salaries of Adrien and Lylah. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of their salaries. 
Solution: Four years ago, Adrien was earning 30% more than Lylah, which means Lylah was earning $40000/1.3 = $30769.23. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he was earning $40000*1.4 = $56000. Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, she was earning $30769.23*1.4 = $43076.92. Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $56000 + $43076.92 = $99076.92.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_120, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pads of paper used per week (2), Number of sheets in a pad (30), Number of weeks in a month (4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sheets of paper used, we need to consider the number of pads used per week, the number of sheets in a pad, and the number of weeks in a month. Miguel's weight is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad of paper has 30 sheets. Therefore, in a week, he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets of paper. A month typically has about 4 weeks. Therefore, in a month, he uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets of paper.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_121, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of fruits (Changes from 13 to 27)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of fruits, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the fruits when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought by adding the number of apples (5) and oranges (8) she brought, which equals 13. Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which is 2*5 = 10 apples, and half the number of oranges than Morisette, which is 8/2 = 4 oranges. Adding these together, Kael brought 14 fruits. The total number of fruits they brought is the sum of the fruits Morisette brought and the fruits Kael brought, which is 13 + 14 = 27.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_122, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours of sleep (Changes from 8 to 6 to 7)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total hours of sleep, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating the total hours of sleep.
Solution: Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, which means she slept 8-2=6 hours each day. So for two days, she slept 6*2=12 hours. For the rest of the week, which is 7-3=4 days, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, which means she slept 6+1=7 hours each day. So for four days, she slept 7*4=28 hours. Adding all these up, Sadie slept 8+12+28=48 hours in total throughout the week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_123, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Speed and time (Speed changes from 10 to 5 miles per hour, time is 7 hours)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total distance Rosie can run, we need to consider her speed and the time she runs. The humidity is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: First, we calculate how many miles Rosie can run in the first 3 hours by multiplying her speed (10 miles per hour) by the time (3 hours). This gives us 30 miles. After 3 hours, her speed changes to 5 miles per hour. We then calculate how many miles she can run in the remaining 4 hours (7 hours total - 3 hours already calculated) by multiplying her speed (5 miles per hour) by the time (4 hours). This gives us 20 miles. Finally, we add the miles she ran in the first 3 hours (30 miles) to the miles she ran in the last 4 hours (20 miles) to get the total miles she can run in 7 hours, which is 50 miles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of spoons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the spoons when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Julia had a total of 12 spoons after her husband gave her 5 new spoons and she used 3 spoons for tasting the stew. So, the total number of spoons she had before her husband gave her the spoons and she used some for tasting is 12 + 3 - 5 = 10. Therefore, the package of spoons that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of sausages, the weight of the sausages is not relevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.
Solution: Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages (38) and fish sausages (44). 38 and 44 make 82.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of friends Lily and Amy have, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the school when counting the total number of friends.
Solution: First, we find out how many friends Amy has. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, Amy has 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Then, to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has. So, 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of elves, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the village when counting the remaining elves.
Solution: Nissa starts with 60 elves. A third of them quit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves. So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves remain. Then, 10 more elves quit, so 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total expenditure, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Joseph when calculating the total expenditure.
Solution: To find the total expenditure for the two months, we first need to find out how much Joseph spent in June. Since his expenditure in June was $60 less than in May, we subtract $60 from $500, which gives us $440. We then add the expenditures for May ($500) and June ($440) to get the total expenditure for the two months. So, $500 + $440 = $940.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_132, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of rides (Changes from individual rides to total rides), Cost per ride (Constant at 6 tickets)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of tickets used, which is determined by the number of rides taken and the cost per ride, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many rides Pam and Fred took in total. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, making a total of 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, making a total of 6 rides. Together, they rode 10 times. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, we multiply the total number of rides (10) by the cost per ride (6). 10 multiplied by 6 equals 60.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_133, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Miles walked each day (Changes from 4 miles on Monday, 24 miles on Tuesday, to an unknown amount on Wednesday)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance Walt walked each day, the humidity levels are irrelevant to the calculation. We need to find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday. 
Solution: To do this, we first calculate how many miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, he therefore walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday. We know that his total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. So, to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage. That is, 41 - 4 - 24 = 13 miles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_134, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of car washes per month (4), cost per car wash ($15)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of car washes, the temperature at the car wash is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the number of car washes and the cost per wash.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much Tom pays in a month. Since each car wash costs $15 and he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply 15 by 4 to get $60. This is how much he pays in a month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost ($60) by the number of months in a year (12). So, 60 multiplied by 12 equals 720.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_135, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of video games (Changes from 20 to 15 for Brian and calculated for Bobby)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of video games Brian and Bobby have. The weight of Bobby is irrelevant to the problem. 
Solution: First, we find out how many video games Brian has left after losing 5. He initially had 20, so after losing 5, he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. So, we multiply Brian's number of video games by 3, which gives us 15 * 3 = 45. Since Bobby has 5 fewer than this, we subtract 5 from 45, which gives us 45 - 5 = 40. So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of unicorns, specifically those in the Scottish Highlands and their gender, there is no need to consider the humidity level when calculating the number of female Scottish unicorns.
Solution: First, we find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. One third of 27 is 9. Then, we find out how many of these are female. Two thirds of 9 is 6. Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the delivery order. The weight of Rory before and after eating is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. 
Solution: First, we calculate the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies separately by multiplying the cost of each item by the quantity ordered. This gives us $15.00 for the subs, $3.00 for the chips, and $2.00 for the cookies. We then add these amounts together to get the subtotal of $20.00. Next, we calculate the delivery fee by multiplying the subtotal by 20%, which gives us $4.00. We add this to the subtotal, along with the $5.00 tip, to get the total cost of the order, which is $29.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of questions left incomplete, the temperature of the room is irrelevant to the solution. We need to consider the number of questions, the time given for each test, and the rate at which Mark completes the questions.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many questions Mark was able to complete in the given time. He completes 5 questions per hour. So, for the first test, he had 8 hours which means he completed 8*5 = 40 questions. For the second test, he had 6 hours which means he completed 6*5 = 30 questions. So, in total, he completed 40+30 = 70 questions. But the total number of questions in both tests was 75+100 = 175. So, the number of questions he left incomplete is 175-70 = 105.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_140, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of automatic cars (12), manual cars (4), and total cars (20)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. The humidity changes are irrelevant to the calculation of the percentage of semi-automatic cars.
Solution: First, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. That is, 20 - 12 - 4 = 4. So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars. To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100. That is, (4/20) * 100 = 20%. So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_141, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of bees (Remains 700), Worker bees (Changes from unknown to 400)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of worker bees, which we need to find, there is no need to consider the humidity level in the hive when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many bees are there in each category. Given that there are twice as many babies as queens, and twice as many workers as babies, we can set up the equation as follows: workers = 2*babies, babies = 2*queens. Since the total number of bees is 700, we have the equation: workers + babies + queens = 700. Substituting the values, we get: 2*babies + babies + (babies/2) = 700. Solving this equation, we find that there are 200 babies. Since there are twice as many workers as babies, there are 400 worker bees.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_144, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of clients (Changes from 3 to 8), Cost per client (Remains constant at $9), Total income (Remains constant at $92)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the calculation of profit, which is the difference between total income and total expenses, we don't need to consider the area of the homes Kim cleans. The total number of clients and the cost per client are the relevant variables here.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total number of clients Kim has, which is 3 existing clients plus 5 potential clients, totalling 8 clients. For each client, Kim needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, costing $2 and $5 respectively. Therefore, the total cost for each client is 2*$2 + $5 = $9. As Kim has 8 clients, his total expenses will be 8*$9 = $72. Kim's total income is $92, so his profit is his income minus his expenses, which is $92 - $72 = $20.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year. The humidity level is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out how many pineapples are in one hectare, multiply that by the total hectares to get the total number of pineapples, and then multiply that by the number of harvests per year.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pineapples are in one hectare. Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, and John has 10 hectares, he has 1000 pineapples in total (100 * 10).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_146, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of lego pieces (Changes from 500 to 2125)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of lego pieces, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the legos when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Johnny had three sets of legos to pick up. The first set had 500 pieces. The second set had 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The third set had 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces. To find the total number of legos Johnny picked up, we add the number of pieces in each set: 500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set) = 2125 pieces.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_147, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of bees (Changes based on the time of the day)
Explanation: The problem is about the number of bees that Debra sees leaving and returning to the hive. The humidity around the hive is irrelevant to the problem as it does not affect the number of bees that Debra sees.
Solution: In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive. In the next 6 hours, she sees half that many, or 15, return. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times the number of bees that she first saw leave the hive, or 60, leave again. In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned, returns to the hive. This means that 30 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) - 15 (that had already returned) = 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_148, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of tickets (Adult ticket is $12 and child ticket is $10), Change received ($8)
Explanation: The problem involves the total cost of the tickets and the change received. The humidity is irrelevant to the problem and does not affect the calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Adding these together, we get $22. Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that she gave the cashier more money than the cost of the tickets. To find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the cost of the tickets ($22) to the amount of change she received ($8). $22 + $8 equals $30. Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of Facebook friends Charlie, Dorothy, and James have. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the number of Facebook friends each person has.
Solution: In the problem, it is stated that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, this means Dorothy has 12 divided by 3, which equals 4 friends. The problem also states that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, James has 4 times 4, which equals 16 friends.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_151, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of tires (Changes from 0 to 20)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total money made, which is calculated by the number of tires inflated, there is no need to consider the volume of the inflated tires when calculating the total amount made.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. Bicycles have 2 tires, tricycles have 3, and unicycles have 1. So, 5 bicycles mean 5*2=10 tires, 3 tricycles mean 3*3=9 tires, and 1 unicycle means 1*1=1 tire. In total, Shawnda inflated 10+9+1=20 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so she made 20*25=500 cents. Since 100 cents make a dollar, she made 500/100=5 dollars.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of cookies bought by Carl and the change he receives. The weight of the cookies is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl bought in total. Since each pack has 6 cookies and he bought 10 packs, he bought 6*10 = 60 cookies. Each cookie cost $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60*$0.10 = $6.00. If Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of bananas needed, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the bananas when calculating the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to add up the number of bananas each type of ape needs per month and then multiply by 2. The monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas. So, in total, they need 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas per month. Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he would need 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas for 2 months.

Explanation: The problem deals with the distance run by Blake and Kelly. The humidity does not affect the distance run, hence it is irrelevant to the problem. 
Solution: First, we calculate how far each person ran. Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100 yard field, so he ran 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards. Kelly ran back and forth once on the 100 yard field, so she ran 2 * 100 = 200 yards. Then, she ran to the 40 yard line and back 34 times, so she ran 34 * 2 * 40 = 2720 yards. So in total, Kelly ran 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards. Therefore, Blake ran 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards farther than Kelly.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost of the items bought, we do not need to consider Raphael's weight. We need to calculate the total cost of each item and add them up.
Solution: First, we multiply the number of pens (4) by the cost per pen ($1.5) to get $6. Then, we multiply the number of notebooks (2) by the cost per notebook ($4) to get $8. Finally, we add the cost of the bond paper ($20) to these amounts. So, $6 (for pens) + $8 (for notebooks) + $20 (for bond paper) equals $34.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the water depth, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating the water depth.
Solution: To find the water depth on Wednesday, we first need to find the water depth on Tuesday. On Monday, the water depth was 17 feet and on Tuesday, there was an increase of 7 feet. So, the water depth on Tuesday is 17 + 7 = 24 feet. On Wednesday, the water depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, the water depth on Wednesday is 2/3 * 24 = 16 feet.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of fish caught, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish, which totals to 19 fish (10+6+3). Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 5 (10-5), 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is 3 (6-3), and 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is 5 (3+2). This totals to 13 fish (5+3+5). Adding the total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught, we get 32 fish (19+13).

Explanation: The problem deals with the financial decision Jackie has to make. We need to compare the cost of doing the taxes herself, which is the income she would lose from the freelance work, with the cost of hiring an accountant. The temperature change in the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate how much money Jackie would lose if she did the taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, which is $35/hour. So, she would lose 3 * $35 = $105. If she hires an accountant, she would have to pay $90. So, the difference between the two options is $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, Jackie would have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Elvira has left after buying a computer and accessories. The weight of the items is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to subtract the total cost of the items from her total budget to find out how much money she has left.
Solution: Elvira has a total budget of €1500. She spends €1090 on the computer, €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of all the items she bought from her total budget. So, 1500 - 1090 - 157 - 74 - 102 = €77.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the age of Seth and Brooke, there is no need to consider their weights when calculating their ages. 
Solution: Let's denote Brooke's age as x. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's age is 2x. In 2 years, Brooke will be x+2 years old and Seth will be 2x+2 years old. The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can set up the equation: (x+2) + (2x+2) = 28. Solving this equation, we get x=8. Therefore, Seth's current age is 2x = 2*8 = 16.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of legs Jake sees, we only need to consider the number of each creature and the number of legs each creature has. The humidity in the museum is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to multiply the number of each creature by the number of legs each creature has, and then add those totals together. For the spiders, 80 spiders times 8 legs each equals 640 legs. For the insects, 90 insects times 6 legs each equals 540 legs. For the mutant invertebrates, 3 invertebrates times 10 legs each equals 30 legs. Adding these totals together, 640 legs from spiders, 540 legs from insects, and 30 legs from invertebrates, gives us a total of 1210 legs.

Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of the birds, so the humidity is irrelevant. We know that Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are both 8 years old. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, which makes her 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, which makes her 19 years old. To find the total age of all the birds, we add all these ages together.
Solution: The ages of the birds are Sally Four (8), Sally Thirtytwo (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19). Adding these together gives us 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

Explanation: The problem is about calculating Jessica's total payment in a year, given that she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total minimum payment Jessica has to make each month. This is done by adding the minimum payments of her student loans ($300), credit card ($200), and mortgage ($500). This gives us a total of $1000. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this amount, so we calculate 50% of $1000, which is $500. Adding this to the minimum payment, we get $1500 as the amount Jessica pays each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year). This gives us $18000.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time taken to prep the potatoes, we only need to consider the time taken to peel and cut each potato, and the total number of potatoes. The weight of the potatoes is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends on peeling and cutting each potato. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes by dividing 5 by 60, which gives us approximately 0.083 minutes. Adding this to the peeling time, we find that Billy spends about 1.583 minutes on each potato. Multiplying this by the total number of potatoes (60), we find that it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_176, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of Asians (240), Number of Japanese (80), Number of Chinese boys (60)
Explanation: The problem involves finding the number of girls on the Chinese team. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation. We first find the total number of Chinese participants, which is the total number of Asians minus the number of Japanese. Then, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.
Solution: The total number of Chinese participants is 240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160. If the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60, then the number of girls on the Chinese team would be 160 (total Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100. So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_179, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours tutored (Changes from 5 to 8), hourly rate ($10)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total earnings of Lloyd from tutoring. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of his earnings. We need to consider the number of hours he tutored and his hourly rate.
Solution: To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored by his hourly rate. For the first week, he tutored 5 hours, so he earned 5 * $10 = $50. For the second week, he tutored 8 hours, so he earned 8 * $10 = $80. To find the total earnings, we add the earnings of the first week and the second week, which gives us $50 + $80 = $130.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_181, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies.
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of flowers ordered, specifically red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies. The humidity in the shop is irrelevant to the number of flowers ordered.
Solution: From the problem, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations and 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is 4 times the number of white carnations, which is 4*40 = 160.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_182, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Ages of Jean, Mark and Jan (Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, Jan is currently 30)
        Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Jean, Mark and Jan. The humidity levels are irrelevant to determining their ages. 
        Solution: From the problem, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Given that Jan is currently 30 years old, we can find Mark's age by halving Jan's age and adding 5. This gives us 15 + 5 = 20. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is therefore 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken by each team to finish the race, we disregard the humidity levels which do not affect the time taken by each team.
Solution: First, calculate the total time for each team to run the relay. For the well-rounded team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds, so the total time is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds. For the less well-rounded team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds. So the total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds. The well-rounded team wins by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_184, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3, Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
Explanation: As the problem deals with probabilities of rolling certain numbers on a die, the humidity in the room is irrelevant and does not affect the outcome of the rolls.
Solution: There are six possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (i.e., 4, 5, or 6) is 3 out of 6, or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6)*(3/6) = 9/36 = 25%. Therefore, it is 50% - 25% = 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount Mandy owes to Benedict, the weight of Mandy is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total amount owed including the interest for 3 months.
Solution: To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we first need to calculate the interest for each month. The monthly interest is 2% of $100, which is $2. Therefore, after 3 months, the total interest would be 3 * $2 = $6. Adding this to the original amount that Mandy owes Benedict, we get $100 + $6 = $106.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of bags sold, the cost of buying and transporting each bag, and the total profit made by the trader. The weight of the wheat is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The cost of buying each bag is $20 and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost is $22x. The trader sells each bag at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling the bags is $30x. The trader's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is $30x - $22x = $8x. We know that the trader made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation $8x = $400. Solving for 'x', we get x = 50. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_189, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of tickets ($20.25), Cost of food ($4.50 less than tickets), Cost of rides (2 rides at $33 each), Number of friends (3)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost each friend has to pay. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost.
Solution: First, we find the total cost of the tickets, which is $20.25. The food cost is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. The cost of the rides is $33 each, and since they went on 2 rides, that's 2 * $33 = $66. So, the total cost is $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102. The cost is split evenly among the 3 friends, so each friend pays $102 / 3 = $34.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of peaches collected, which depends on the time spent and the rate of collection, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of peaches.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many minutes John spent collecting peaches. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and he spent 3 hours, that's 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Then, since he collects 2 peaches a minute, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches per minute. So, 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of insects eaten by the ducks, the humidity in their environment is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total amount of insects eaten by the flock in a week, and then find out how much they eat per day.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ducks eat in a week. Since each duck eats 3.5 pounds per week, and there are 10 ducks, we multiply 3.5 by 10 to get 35 pounds. Then, to find out how many pounds they eat per day, we divide the weekly total by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, 35 divided by 7 equals 5.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_192, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of trees (Changes from 50 to 91)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of trees, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity. However, the problem does state that 30% of the trees die, which is a relevant variable.
Solution: Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, in a year, the net increase in the number of trees is 10 - 2 = 8. Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is 8 * 10 = 80. So, before accounting for the trees that die, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. However, 30% of these trees die. The number of trees that die is 30/100 * 130 = 39. So, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of flamingos, we do not need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity of each color of flamingos.
Solution: On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, one third of these were taken, painted white, and put back. One third of 18 is 6, so there were 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos left. On Sunday, another 18 pink flamingos were added, making the total number of pink flamingos 30 (12 + 18). So, there were 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos (30 - 6).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the change Violetta will get after buying crayons, we only need to consider the number of crayons she needs, the cost of one crayon, and the money she prepared. Her weight is irrelevant to this problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much Violetta will spend on crayons. Since one crayon costs $2 and she needs them in 5 different colors, she will spend 2*5 = $10 on crayons. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase, so to find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the crayons from the money she prepared. 20 - 10 = $10. So, Violetta will get $10 change.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_195, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of pen (Does not change), Number of pens (Changes from 1 to 8)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of pens, the weight of the pen is irrelevant, even though it changes. The cost of a pen is found by adding the cost of a pencil and an eraser, which remains constant even after the pen's weight changes. Therefore, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.
Solution: First, we find the cost of a pen by adding the cost of a pencil ($1.20) and an eraser ($0.30) which gives us $1.50. Then, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen ($1.50) by 8. This gives us $12.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants and subtract it from the total amount of carrots available. The temperature changes are irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the restaurants. Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots and there are 40 restaurants, we multiply 2 by 40 to get 80 pounds. Then, we subtract this amount from the total amount of carrots available, which is 200 pounds. So, 200 minus 80 equals 120 pounds. This is the amount of carrots that will not be used.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of Pokemon cards, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In the first month, Elaine collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 200 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards she has now is the sum of the cards she initially had and the cards she collected in the three months, which is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total earnings of Mark in a week. To calculate this, we need to know the number of sentences he edits and the rate per sentence he gets paid. The temperature of the room where Mark works is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A. Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, Mark earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B. To find the total amount Mark earns in a week, we add the amount he earns from Publisher A and Publisher B. So, 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total money John made in a year. His weight gain due to stress and celebration is irrelevant to the calculation of his annual income.
Solution: John's initial weekly salary is $2000. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary before the raise is $2000 * 52 = $104,000. After receiving the award, his salary increases by 5%. So the increase in his salary is 5/100 * $104,000 = $5200. Therefore, his new annual salary after the raise is $104,000 + $5200 = $109,200. Adding the one-time award of $5000, the total money he made that year is $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200.

Solution: Carl ate a sandwich every day for a week, which is 7 days. Since he used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, he used 2*7 = 14 slices of cheese for the sandwiches. He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week and used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. So he used 3*(2+1) = 9 slices of cheese for the omelets. He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it. So in total, he used 14+9+8 = 31 slices of cheese.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_204, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pens (Changes from 32 to 98)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of pens that Janet has. The weight of Janet is irrelevant to the total number of pens she has. Therefore, we only need to consider the number of each type of pen she has.
Solution: First, we add the number of green pens (22) and yellow pens (10) that Janet initially had, which gives us 32 pens. Then, we multiply the number of bags of blue pens (6) by the number of pens in each bag (9), which gives us 54 blue pens. We do the same for the red pens: 2 bags times 6 pens in each bag equals 12 red pens. Finally, we add all these numbers together: 32 initial pens plus 54 blue pens plus 12 red pens equals 98 pens in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cakes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. Since she bought three times the number of cakes she did on Monday, we multiply 4 (the number of cakes she bought on Monday) by 3 to get 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. So, we multiply 12 (the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday) by 5 to get 60 cakes. To find out the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes she bought each day together: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_211, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of red chickens (denoted as x), number of white chickens (denoted as x+2), eggs produced by red chickens (3 per day), eggs produced by white chickens (5 per day), total eggs collected (42 per day)
Explanation: The problem involves finding the number of red chickens. The humidity changes in the coop are irrelevant to this calculation. We know that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42, and each red chicken produces 3 eggs while each white chicken produces 5. Given that the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of red chickens.
Solution: Let's denote the number of red chickens as x. Then the number of white chickens is x+2. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs each and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each, we can set up the following equation: 3x + 5(x+2) = 42. Solving this equation, we find that x = 4. So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_212, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance of the park (15 miles), Gary's walking speed (3 miles/hour)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time Gary spends walking, which is calculated by dividing the total distance he walks by his speed. The temperature changes during his walk, but this is irrelevant to the calculation of time.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total distance Gary walks. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, the total distance is 2*(6 + 1.5) = 15 miles. Now, we know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles/hour. So, to find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed. Hence, 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_213, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of customers (Changes from 100 to 150 to 500)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of customers, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which totals to 150 customers (100 from the first day + 50 additional). So, the total number of customers for the first two days is 250 (100 from the first day + 150 from the second day). If the total number of customers by the third day was 500, then the number of customers she counted on the third day would be the total number of customers by the third day minus the total number of customers for the first two days. Therefore, 500 (total by the third day) - 250 (total for the first two days) = 250 customers on the third day.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water in the pools, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature around the pools when calculating the current amount of water.
Solution: Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x gallons. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons. In 4 minutes, each pool lost 4*4=16 gallons of water due to the leaks. So, the small pool now has x-16 gallons and the big pool has 2x-16 gallons. According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation 2x-16=4*(x-16). Solving this equation, we find that x=24. Therefore, the small pool now has 24-16=8 gallons of water.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total hours Lori needs to work to afford her purchases, the weight gain is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total cost of the items and her hourly wage.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total cost of the shoes and belt. This is done by adding the cost of the shoes ($320.00) and the cost of the belt ($32.00), which gives us a total of $352.00. Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn this amount. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost ($352.00) by her hourly wage ($8.00). This gives us 44 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time Carmen spent playing games, we only need to consider the time she spent on each type of puzzle. The change in humidity in her room is irrelevant to the total time spent playing games.
Solution: First, calculate the total time Carmen spent on crossword puzzles. She solved 3 crossword puzzles, each taking 10 minutes, so she spent 3 * 10 = 30 minutes on crossword puzzles. Next, calculate the total time Carmen spent on sudoku puzzles. She solved 8 sudoku puzzles, each taking 5 minutes, so she spent 8 * 5 = 40 minutes on sudoku puzzles. To find the total time Carmen spent on both types of puzzles, add the time she spent on crossword puzzles to the time she spent on sudoku puzzles. So, 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water in the tank, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the water when calculating the total amount.
Solution: First, we subtract the amount of water used by Celine from the total amount of water in the tank. This gives us 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Then, we calculate the amount of rainwater collected, which is twice the amount left in the tank. This gives us 2 * 30 = 60 liters. Finally, we add the amount of rainwater collected to the amount left in the tank to get the total amount of water in the tank now. This gives us 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount spent on advertising over two years. The size of the office space is irrelevant to the calculation of the total advertising expenditure.
Solution: First, we find the amount spent on advertising in the second year by dividing the first year's advertising budget ($15000) by 3, which gives us $5000. Then, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years. So, $15000 (first year) + $5000 (second year) = $20000.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the probability of picking a water type card, we need to consider the total number of cards and the number of water type cards. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: James initially has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. This makes a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards. He then loses 8 water type cards, reducing the total number of water type cards to 40 - 8 = 32 and the total number of cards to 90 - 8 = 82. He then buys 14 more grass type cards, increasing the total number of cards to 82 + 14 = 96. The number of water type cards remains 32. Therefore, the chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time it will take to complete the puzzle. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the solution. We need to find out how many pieces they can collectively add per minute and then divide the total number of pieces by this rate.
Solution: Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can add 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can add 6 pieces per minute. The puzzle has 360 pieces, so we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can add per minute to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle. 360 divided by 6 is 60. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of watermelons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity level of the farm when counting the remaining watermelons.
Solution: Initially, the farm had 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn harvested 30% of them after two months, which is 30/100 * 120 = 36 watermelons. This leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons on the farm. When she came back two weeks later, she harvested 3/4 of the remaining melons, which is 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons. This leaves 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested.

Solution: First, we need to calculate how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat in a week. Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, he eats 6*7 = 42 tomatoes a week. His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 42/2 = 21 tomatoes a week. Together, they eat 42+21 = 63 tomatoes a week. Since a vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, they will need 63/3 = 21 vines to have enough tomatoes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_235, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of friends (20), slices per friend (4), slices per pizza (8)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pizzas needed. The area of the room is irrelevant to this calculation. We know that each friend needs 4 slices, and each pizza is divided into 8 slices. 
Solution: John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices of pizza. This means he needs a total of 20 friends * 4 slices = 80 slices of pizza. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, the total number of pizzas he needs to order is 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_236, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pens (Changes from 25 to 30)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pens, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the bag when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, Ram uses the 25 pens he bought. When they are empty, he can combine the ink from every 5 pens to make 1 new pen. So, he takes the 25 pens, divides by 5, which gives 5 new pens. Adding these 5 new pens to the original 25 pens, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money, which we already have, there is no need to consider Johnny's weight when calculating the total amount of money.
Solution: First, Johnny added his allowance of $20 to an extra $10, giving him a total of $30. He then invested this money, and it tripled in a year. To find the total amount of money he had after a year, we multiply the initial investment ($30) by 3. 30 times 3 equals 90.

Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of the three girls. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of their ages.
Solution: First, we find Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age. So, Joan is 25 years old (20+5). Then, we find Mary's age by subtracting 2 from Joan's age. So, Mary is 23 years old (25-2). Finally, we add the ages of the three girls to get the total. So, 20 (Jessa's age) + 25 (Joan's age) + 23 (Mary's age) = 68.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_240, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of candies (John has 54, James has 6 more than Robert, Robert has half of John's candies)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of candies each person has. The weight of James is irrelevant to the problem. 
Solution: First, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if John has 54 candies, then Robert has 54/2 = 27 candies. Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has. So, 54 - 33 = 21 candies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of books each person has and how many they will read. The weight of Dolly and Pandora is irrelevant to the question.
Solution: Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they both read each other's books as well as their own, they will read a total of 3 books each. So, Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, making 3 books in total. Similarly, Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, making 3 books in total. Therefore, collectively, they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of minutes left in Jason's phone plan. His weight is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to calculate the total minutes spent on calls with his boss and other people, and subtract this from the total minutes in his plan.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss in a month. Since he spends 15 minutes every day, and there are 30 days in a month, he spends 15*30 = 450 minutes on calls with his boss. He also has 300 extra minutes of calls. So, the total number of minutes he has used is 450 (boss calls) + 300 (extra calls) = 750 minutes. Since his plan has 1000 minutes, the number of minutes he has left is 1000 (total minutes) - 750 (used minutes) = 250 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_244, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of fries (Changes from 24 to 27)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of fries, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Griffin when counting the total quantity of fries.
Solution: Griffin initially had 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries and Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2*5=10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 24-5-10=9 fries. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5-3=2 fries. So, Griffin was left with 9-2=7 fries. If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, it means Ginger gave Griffin 27-7=20 fries.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_245, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of snails (Changes from 4 to 32), Number of fish (Unknown)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of fish, which we don't know, and the number of snails, which we do know, there is no need to consider the humidity of the aquariums when calculating the number of fish.
Solution: First, find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. This gives 32 - 4 = 28 snails. Since the difference in the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, divide this number by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium. This gives 28 / 2 = 14 fish in total. Since the number of fish in each aquarium is the same, divide this number by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium. This gives 14 / 2 = 7 fish in each aquarium.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_246, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Makeup artist's hourly rate, hours per day, days per week, weeks, and discount rate
Explanation: The problem is asking for the total amount Jean paid for her makeup services. The weight is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours each day, so the cost per day is $250 * 6 = $1500. Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week, so the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total cost without the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000. The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so the final cost is $30000 - $30000 * 10% = $27000.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_247, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of party supplies (Changes from $0 to $96), Number of people sharing the cost (3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of party supplies and how it is shared among people, there is no need to consider the weight of the supplies. We only need to find the total cost and divide it by the number of people.
Solution: We first find the total cost of the party supplies by adding the cost of the cake ($12), presents ($43), decorations ($15), invitations ($4), and goodie bags ($22) to get a total of $96. Since the cost was split evenly among three people (Isabelle and her two parents), we divide the total cost by 3. $96 divided by 3 equals $32. So, each person paid $32.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost spent by the chef on onions. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. 
Solution: First, we need to find the total weight of onions the chef bought. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, the total weight is 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds. Then, we need to find the total cost of these onions. Since a pound of onions cost $1.50, the total cost is 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_249, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister (Changes from Monday to Tuesday)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies eaten, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when calculating the total calories consumed.
Solution: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister who ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. So, Sue ate 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, then Sue consumed 28 * 200 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of animals killed, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: On the first day, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars, which totals to 25 animals. On the second day, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he killed 15 wolves (since he killed 5 cougars, which is three fewer than the previous night's 15). He also killed 5 cougars on the second day. So, on the second day, he killed 20 animals. Adding the animals killed on both days, we get 25 (from the first day) + 20 (from the second day) = 45 animals in total.

        Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of times each child went down the slide, we don't need to consider the change in humidity when calculating the total count.
        Solution: First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of 30 (Mitchel's count), which is 9. So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, Robert went down the slide 21 * 4 = 84 times.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cows in the stalls, we do not need to consider the weight of the cows when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially, each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, making a total of 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys an additional 40 cows and distributes them equally among the stalls, adding 4 cows to each stall. Therefore, each stall now contains 24 cows. To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall (24) by the number of stalls (8). This gives us a total of 192 cows.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount Nancy has to pay, the weight of Nancy is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of overdue books, the cost per book, and the flat fee.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Nancy owes for the overdue books. Since she has 8 books and each book costs $0.50, we multiply 8 by 0.50 to get $4.00. Then, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, 4.00 + 2.00 equals $6.00.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of fruits, which includes both apples and bananas. The weight of Jamal is not relevant to the total number of fruits. 
Solution: First, we know that Andrea has 52 apples. Because Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can subtract 8 from Andrea's number of apples to find out that Jamal has 44 apples. Jamal also has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 48 bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 24 bananas. To find the total number of fruits, we add Andrea's apples (52), Andrea's bananas (24), Jamal's apples (44), and Jamal's bananas (48). This gives us a total of 168 fruits.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies and cups of flour, there is no need to consider the weight of the flour when calculating the total quantity of flour needed.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies Carla is making in total. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to 66 cookies. Since a dozen is 12, we divide 66 by 12 to get 5.5 dozens. Since two cups of flour are needed for each dozen, we multiply 5.5 by 2 to get 11 cups of flour.

Solution: First, we find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6/2 = 3 trees. Next, we find out how many trees Harry has. Since Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, and Ferdinand has 3 trees, Harry has 5 + 2*3 = 11 trees. To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard. So, 11 - 3 = 8 trees.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_264, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money each girl has (Carmen: $100, Samantha: $125, Daisy: $175)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount of money the girls have, we do not need to consider their weights. We simply need to add up the amounts of money each girl has.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Samantha has by adding $25 to Carmen's $100, which gives us $125. Then, we find out how much money Daisy has by adding $50 to Samantha's $125, which gives us $175. Finally, we add up the amounts of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have, which are $100, $125, and $175 respectively. Adding these amounts gives us a total of $400.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost spent on ads, we need to consider the cost of each ad and the number of each type of ad bought. The total area of the ads is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, calculate the total cost of newspaper ads by multiplying the cost of each newspaper ad ($5) by the number of newspaper ads bought (50). This gives $5 * 50 = $250. Next, calculate the total cost of television ads by multiplying the cost of each television ad ($75) by the number of television ads bought (15). This gives $75 * 15 = $1125. Finally, add the total cost of newspaper ads ($250) and television ads ($1125) to find the total cost of all ads. $250 + $1125 = $1375.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of M&Ms, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the bags when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms. Adding these together, Mary got 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Explanation: The problem is about the change the mother gets back after shopping. The weight of the mother is irrelevant in this context. We only need to consider the cost of the items she bought and the amount she paid.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the mother spent. She bought cocoa for $4.20, laundry for $9.45, and pasta for $1.35. Adding these together gives $15.00. She paid with $20.00. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she paid. So, $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00. Therefore, the cashier gives her back $5.00.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of stitches, which we already have. There is no need to consider the weight of the yarn when calculating the number of stitches for each sleeve.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the body stitches, so it takes 900/10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90*2 = 180 stitches. The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the two sleeves together take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. Therefore, each sleeve takes 630/2 = 315 stitches.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost of the seeds, which is determined by the number of packets and the cost per packet, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds by multiplying the number of packets (20) by the cost per packet ($40). This gives us 20 * 40 = $800. Next, we calculate the total cost of the celery seeds by multiplying the number of packets (80) by the cost per packet ($30). This gives us 80 * 30 = $2400. Finally, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total cost. $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of lines Sean has to memorize, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total lines.
Solution: To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to add up all the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene. The song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2*54=108 lines, but only a third of them are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108/3=36 lines from the first scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song, which is 54+6=60 lines, and four-fifths of them are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60*(4/5)=48 lines from the second scene. Adding all these up, Sean has to memorize 54+36+48=138 lines.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cards, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cards when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many cards have the letter A on them. This is 2/5 of 80, which equals 32. Subtracting this from the total, we have 80 - 32 = 48 cards left. Next, we find out how many cards have the letter B on them. This is 1/2 of 48, which equals 24. Subtracting this from the remaining, we have 48 - 24 = 24 cards left. Then, we find out how many cards have the letter C on them. This is 5/8 of 24, which equals 15. Subtracting this from the remaining, we have 24 - 15 = 9 cards left. Therefore, 9 cards have the letter D on them.

We need to calculate the total time it takes to dig the small holes and the large holes, then add these times together and convert the total time from minutes to hours.
Solution: 
Step 1: Calculate the total time for small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
Step 2: Calculate the total time for large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.
Step 3: Add the total times: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.
Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours: 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of Sam and Ruby, the humidity in the room is irrelevant to finding Sam's current age. 
Solution: Let's denote Sam's current age as x. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is 6x. In 9 years, Sam will be x + 9 years old and Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old. The problem states that at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation 6x + 9 = 3 * (x + 9). Solving this equation, we get x = 6. So, Sam is 6 years old now.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost, we only need to consider the number of items purchased and their respective costs. The weight of Peter is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. Since each popsicle costs $0.25 and Peter bought 20, we multiply 20 by 0.25 to get $5.00. Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. Since each ice cream bar costs $0.50 and Peter bought 4, we multiply 4 by 0.50 to get $2.00. Finally, we add the cost of the popsicles ($5.00) and the ice cream bars ($2.00) to get the total cost, which is $7.00.

Explanation: The problem deals with the length of the necklace and the lengths of the gemstones and beads used. The weight of the gemstones is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, each one inch long. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 * 1 = 8 inches. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Therefore, the length of the necklace that needs to be filled with sterling silver beads is 25 - 8 = 17 inches. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads used is 17 / 0.25 = 68.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_286, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of quarters and dimes (5 quarters and 2 dimes), cost of can of pop (55 cents)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Kelly has and how much she will spend, the weight of the coins is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total value of the quarters and dimes, and then subtract the cost of the can of pop.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has. A quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth 5 * 25 = 125 cents. A dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Therefore, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of 5-star rows. The luminosity of the light illuminating the flag is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of stars in the rows we know about: three rows of 8 stars is 24 stars, and two rows of 6 stars is 12 stars. This totals to 36 stars. Since the flag has 76 stars in total, we subtract the 36 stars we've accounted for from 76, which gives us 40 stars. These remaining stars are in rows of 5, so to find the number of these rows, we divide 40 by 5. This gives us 8 rows of 5 stars.

Explanation: The problem is asking about the number of trucks required to transport the flagstones. The area of the yard is irrelevant to the solution. We need to find the total weight of the flagstones and then determine how many trucks are needed to carry that weight.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much weight the 80 flagstones will be. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so 80 flagstones will weigh 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds. A truck can carry 2000 pounds, so to find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones (6000 pounds) by the weight a truck can carry (2000 pounds). 6000 / 2000 = 3. So, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to cover a certain distance at different speeds, the temperature is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out the time it took for the car in the fast lane to cover 480 miles. Since speed = distance/time, we can rearrange this to time = distance/speed. So, the time taken by the car in the fast lane = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which means it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. So, the time taken by the car in the slow lane = 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of medals, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Ali and Izzy when counting the total number of medals.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we subtract 5 from Ali's total of 22, which gives us 17 medals for Izzy. Adding Ali's and Izzy's medals together gives us a total of 39 medals. Since the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together, we multiply 39 by 10 to get 390.

Explanation: The weight of the chocolate bars is irrelevant to the problem. We need to find out the total number of chocolate bars, how many are taken by the adults, and how many are left for the children.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars. Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, there are 5*8 = 40 chocolate bars in total. If each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, the adults get 6*4 = 24 chocolate bars in total. This leaves 40-24 = 16 chocolate bars to be shared among the children. Since there are 8 children, each child gets 16/8 = 2 chocolate bars.

        Solution: Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a break for half an hour, so she effectively works for 2.5 hours. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, in an hour (which has 60 minutes), she would earn $5 * 6 = $30. Therefore, in 2.5 hours, she would earn $30 * 2.5 = $75.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_293, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Points of Mike, Jim, and Tony (Changes from initial points to final points after extra points are added)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total points of the players, we do not need to consider the humidity in the room. The points of each player are calculated separately and then added together to get the total points.
Solution: After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which means Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, which means Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points. In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony each get an extra point, making their totals 22 and 43 respectively. Adding all the points together, we get 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_294, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of oranges (Changes from 15 to 3), Age of sons (8 and 4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of oranges and the ages of the sons, which we already have. The weight of the oranges is irrelevant to the number of oranges left unwashed.
Solution: Will initially has 15 oranges. His oldest son washes 8 oranges because he is 8 years old. His youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 4 years old, so he washes 4 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed by the sons from the total number of oranges. So, 15 - 8 - 4 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_295, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of exercises (Changes from 170 to 370)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total count of exercises, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Darren when counting the total number of exercises.
Solution: On the first day, Darren does a total of 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises. On the second day, he does 100 pushups + 20 pushups = 120 pushups, 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses. So, on the second day, he does a total of 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises. Adding the total exercises from the first day and the second day, we get 170 exercises + 200 exercises = 370 exercises.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_296, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of household members (5), amount of rice consumed per meal (0.2 kg), number of meals per day (2), total weight of rice (42 kg)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of rice consumed by the household and how long a bag of rice will last. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and since they eat rice for lunch and dinner, that's 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per person per day. With 5 members in the household, they consume a total of 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg of rice per day. Now, to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total weight of the rice by the daily consumption: 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, the rice will last for 21 days / 7 = 3 weeks.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_297, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of crates sold (Changes from 0 to 65), Target number of crates (Constant at 120)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of crates sold and the target number of crates, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating how many crates Sam was off from his target.
Solution: To find out by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first add up the number of crates he sold each day. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates, on Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. So, 20+15+12+18 equals 65 crates. Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. So, to find out by how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold (65) from his target (120). 120 - 65 equals 55. So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of the desk, which is determined by the initial bid and the number of bid increases. The humidity in the auction hall is irrelevant to the cost of the desk.
Solution: Carmen starts with a bid of $200. There are 3 other people who each bid once, and each time the bid increases by $50. So, the total increase in the bid is 3 * $50 = $150. Carmen's final bid, and thus the cost of the desk, is the initial bid plus the total increase, or $200 + $150 = $350.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_299, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance to work (30 miles), days worked per week (5 days), weeks worked per year (50 weeks), cost per mile ($2), monthly bonus for driver ($150)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost John pays for his driving service in a year. The temperature in the car is irrelevant to the calculation of this cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the total miles driven in a year. John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles a day. He does this for 5 days a week, for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60*5*50 = 15000 miles in a year. He gets charged $2 per mile, so he pays 15000*2 = $30000 for the miles driven. He also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so he pays 150*12 = $1800 in bonuses. Therefore, he pays $30000 + $1800 = $31800 a year for driving.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_300, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Exercise time (Changes from 23 and 16 minutes to 78 minutes)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time Peter exercises, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total exercise time.
Solution: To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to find the total time he exercised on Sunday and Monday. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Adding these two times together, we get 39 minutes. Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined, we multiply this total by 2. 39 minutes multiplied by 2 equals 78 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_301, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pages in a tabloid (32), Number of pages each piece of paper can hold (4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid. Each piece of paper is folded to create 4 pages. Therefore, the humidity in the room, which changes from 30% to 45%, is irrelevant to the calculation of the number of pieces of paper.
Solution: In a tabloid, each piece of paper is folded to create 4 pages. Therefore, to find out how many pieces of paper are used for a 32-page tabloid, we divide the total number of pages (32) by the number of pages each piece of paper can hold (4). 32 divided by 4 equals 8.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_302, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money (Changes from $50 to $15)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money left, the weight of Annika is irrelevant and does not need to be considered in the solution.
Solution: Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Then she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 (food and snacks) + $10 (rides) = $35. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount she started with. So, $50 - $35 = $15.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_303, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of books sold in the second year (65 books)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of books sold and the price of each book to calculate the total amount of money earned. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many books Elise sold in total. We know that she has 50 unsold books out of a collection of 250, so she must have sold 250 - 50 = 200 books. We also know that she sold 45 books this year, and twice as many in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year. This means that in the second year, she must have sold 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books. Since each book sells for 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 65 * 20 = 1300$.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_304, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Watson's daily wage ($100), weekly bonus ($300), number of weeks in April (4)
Explanation: The problem deals with Watson's earnings, so we don't need to consider the temperature changes in the office. Watson earns $100 per day and works for 5 days a week, which gives him $500 per week. Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus each week, making his total weekly earnings $800. Since April has approximately 4 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 4 to find his total earnings for the month.
Solution: Watson earns $100 per day. He works for 5 days a week, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 100*5 = $500. He also gets a $300 bonus each week, so his total weekly earnings are 500+300 = $800. April has approximately 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for April are 800*4 = $3200.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people John lost to, we need to first calculate the number of people he won against. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Since John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, he wins against 80/100 * 20 = 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is 20 - 16 = 4.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, there is no need to consider the humidity in the gym when calculating the time.
Solution: Sandy takes 4 times as long as Joey to lose the same amount of weight. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, then each week he loses 8/4 = 2 pounds. Since Sandy takes 4 times as long, it will take her 4 * 2 = 8 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose 8 pounds, it will take Sandy 8 * 4 = 32 weeks.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of ice cream and milk, and the quantity we are buying. The weight of the tub is irrelevant to the calculation of total savings.
Solution: First, we find the discount for one tub of ice cream, which is $13 - $11 = $2. Since we are buying 2 tubs, the total discount for the ice cream is 2 * $2 = $4. Next, we find the total discount for the milk. Since each packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0.5 and we are buying 4 packets, the total discount for the milk is 4 * $0.5 = $2. Finally, we add the discounts for the ice cream and milk to find the total savings, which is $4 + $2 = $6.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_309, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of days (15), Rate of growth for arms (every 3 days), Rate of growth for legs (every 5 days)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the total number of new limbs grown after 15 days. The humidity in the lab is irrelevant to the number of limbs grown, so we can ignore it. We know that an extra arm grows every three days and an extra leg grows every five days. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of arms and legs grown separately and then add them together.
Solution: For the arms, we divide the total number of days (15) by 3 (the rate at which arms grow), which gives us 5 new arms. For the legs, we divide the total number of days (15) by 5 (the rate at which legs grow), which gives us 3 new legs. Adding the new arms and legs together, we get 5 + 3 = 8.

        Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating Trent's age.
        Solution: First, we find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age (30 - 3 = 27). Then, we find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age (27 + 5 = 32). So, Trent is 32 years old.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of people attending Martha's party. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the number of attendees.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2*6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3*4 = 12 people. So, the total number of people invited is 12+12 = 24 people. However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people who could come is 24-8 = 16 people. Additionally, 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. This is 1/4*8 = 2 people. So, the total number of people who show up for Martha's party is 16-2 = 14 people.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool and multiply it by the cost per cubic foot. The weight of the pool before and after filling is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool, which is length * width * depth. So, 6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet. Then, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot to get the total cost. So, 120 cubic feet * $.1 per cubic foot = $12.

Explanation: In this problem, we are looking for the total number of children in the classroom. The humidity level is irrelevant to this calculation, so we can ignore it. We know the number of boys, and we can calculate the number of girls and nongendered children based on the number of boys.
Solution: Given that there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, there are 3 * 30 = 90 girls. There are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered children. Adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children gives us the total number of children: 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 children.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of people at the party, specifically the number of women left after some people leave. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the number of women left.
Solution: At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 10 people left (40 * 1/4). If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 3 men left (25 - 22). Therefore, the number of women who left is 7 (10 - 3). So, the number of women left at the party is 8 (15 - 7).

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pencils and the number of boxes needed to store them. The weight of the pencils is irrelevant to the solution. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pencils are in one box. Since Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils which total to 26 pencils, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total, giving us 24 pencils in 3 boxes. This means there are 8 pencils in one box. Now, we add the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have, which is 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in one box. So, 72 divided by 8 equals 9. Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_323, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cooling effect of ice cubes (Changes from 13 degrees to 65 degrees), Added cream (Changes from 0 milliliters to 15 milliliters)
        Explanation: The problem deals with how much weaker the coffee becomes, so we need to consider the effect of the ice cubes and the added cream. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation.
        Solution: Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. So, if the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means that 65/13 = 5 ice cubes were used. Therefore, the ice cubes make the coffee 5*12 = 60 milliliters weaker. Then, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, in total, the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_324, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of new records (7), Trade ratio (2 old records for 1 new record)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of old records brought in. The area of the store is irrelevant to this calculation. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new one. Therefore, to find the total number of old records, we multiply the number of new records by 2.
Solution: In order to find the total number of old records brought in, we multiply the number of new records (7) by 2 (since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new one). 7 multiplied by 2 equals 14.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_326, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of people (Changes from unknown to 14)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of people.
Solution: In order to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to backtrack from the total number of people heading to the third stop. At the third stop, there were 20 people. At the second stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so before the second stop there were 20 - 8 + 7 = 19 people. At the first stop, 5 more people got in, so before the first stop (which is the terminal), there were 19 - 5 = 14 people.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_327, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of lollipops (Changes from 24 to 31)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of lollipops, which we already have, there is no need to consider Oscar's weight when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. He gives away 14, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. He buys twice as many as he gave away, so he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This brings his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_328, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Percentage of charge (Changes from 60% to 100%), Time (Changes from unknown to 2 hours)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we only need to consider the rate of charge and the percentage of charge needed. The temperature in the room is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine how much more charge is needed. A fully charged phone has a 100% charge, so we subtract the current charge of 60% from 100% to get 40%. Now, since the phone recharges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes, we multiply the 40% by 3 to get 120 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 120 by 60 to get 2 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_330, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount spent on last shopping trip ($80), rewards earned per $20 spent ($1), total cost of current shopping trip ($43), coupon value (twice the amount of rewards)
        Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money the customer paid on their shopping trip. The temperature of the store is irrelevant to this calculation. 
        Solution: First, we calculate the number of rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 they spend, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, $80 divided by $20 is 4, meaning they earned 4 rewards. Then, we subtract these rewards from the total cost of their current shopping trip, which is $43. So, $43 minus $4 is $39. Finally, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, we subtract 2 times the rewards, which is 2 times $4, or $8, from the remaining cost. $39 minus $8 is $31. Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_335, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of sugar needed (Changes from 30 ounces to 70 ounces)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of sugar needed to make batches of suckers and fudge. The temperature in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the total amount of sugar needed.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since one batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar, 8 batches will need 30 ounces * 8 = 240 ounces. Then, we add the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge, which is 70 ounces. Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed is 240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the final value of the shares, we need to consider the number of shares, the initial price per share, the increase and decrease in price. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the final value of the shares.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the shares Maria bought, which is 8 shares times $8 each, equals to $64. Then, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year, so the total value of the shares becomes $64 plus 50% of $64, equals to $96. In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%, so the final value of the shares is $96 minus 25% of $96, equals to $72.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_337, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of hot dogs (Changes from 2 to 6 to 3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of hot dogs eaten, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the individuals when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, Thomas ate 2*3 = 6 hot dogs. Then, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, and Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, John ate 6/2 = 3 hot dogs. To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. So, 3 - 2 = 1. Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of students in each group, so the temperature is not relevant to the solution. The class of 200 students is split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the last group has 10 less than each of the other groups. 
Solution: Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as 'x'. So, we have 2x for these two groups. The smallest group has 'x - 10' students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200. Solving this equation gives x = 70. Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_339, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of animals (Remains 60), Ratio of chickens to cows (2:1)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of legs of the animals. The humidity in the barn is irrelevant to this calculation. We first need to determine the number of each type of animal, and then multiply by the number of legs each animal has.
Solution: Let's denote the number of cows as x. Therefore, the number of chickens will be 2x. The total number of animals (60) is equal to the sum of the number of chickens and cows, so we can write the equation 2x + x = 60. Solving this equation gives x = 20. Therefore, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is 4*20 (for cows) + 2*40 (for chickens) = 80 + 80 = 160.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total distance Tyson covered in June. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the total distance. We only need to consider the distance Tyson runs daily and the number of days in June.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much more Tyson needs to run according to his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than 5000 meters. So, 1/5 of 5000 meters is 1000 meters. Therefore, Tyson needs to run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day. Now, to find out the total distance he covered in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June. June has 30 days. So, Tyson ran 6000 meters * 30 days = 180000 meters in June.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost difference between Juice Box B and C, the temperature change is irrelevant. We only need to consider the prices of Juice Box A, B, and C.
Solution: Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box B is 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. So, Juice Box C is 4 + 7 = 11 dollars. Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C. So, 11 - 9 = 2 dollars. Therefore, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the percentage increase in earnings, we don't need to consider the temperature at which the factory operates. We only need to calculate the daily earnings when they were selling tractors and when they are selling silos, and then find the percentage increase.
Solution: Initially, the factory was making 10 * $100 = $1000 per day from selling tractors. Now, they make 5 * $220 = $1100 per day from selling silos. The difference in earnings is $1100 - $1000 = $100. The percentage increase in earnings is ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%. Hence, they are making 10% more per day now.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost Madeline spends on her dog per year. The weight of the dog is irrelevant to the calculation of the cost. 
Solution: To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we first need to calculate the monthly cost. The food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is 25*4 = $100. The treats cost $20 per month and the medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total monthly cost is 100 (food) + 20 (treats) + 100 (medicine) = $220. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12), so 220*12 = $2640.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_350, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Duration of activities (Changes from 1 hour to 3 hours to 0.5 hours to 1.5 hours to 2 hours)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total duration of Peyton's after-work activities, we do not need to consider the humidity on different days. 
Solution: Peyton's after-work activities take the following time: Monday's yoga class is 1 hour. Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as the yoga class, so it is 3 hours. Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is half an hour, so it is 0.5 hours. Thursday's museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so it is 1.5 hours. Friday's errands take 2 hours. Adding all these together, we get 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_352, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Initial money ($36), Money spent on sweater ($11), Money given to brother ($4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money saved, we do not need to consider Andrea's weight. We only need to consider the initial amount of money she had and the total amount she spent.
Solution: Andrea initially had $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. This means she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15. To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount she had. So, $36 - $15 = $21. Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_353, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time spent on activities (Changes from 15 hours to 50 hours)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time John spent on various activities. The changes in humidity are irrelevant to the question asked. We need to find out the total time John spent on all activities and then calculate the time he spent sightseeing.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total time John spent on all activities. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 shows which were 2 hours each, so that's 3*2=6 hours. So far, he has spent 6+3+6=15 hours. This was 30% of the time he spent, so the total time he spent is 15/0.3=50 hours. He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time he spent sightseeing is 50*0.4=20 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_354, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Money earned from first job, Money earned from second job, Money already saved, Cost of phone
Explanation: As the problem deals with money needed to buy a phone, we don't need to consider the temperature at her jobs. We only need to calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her two jobs, add this to her savings, and subtract this total from the cost of the phone.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much money Annabelle earned from her two jobs. At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and worked for 20 hours, so she earned 10 * 20 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, so she earned 5 * 15 = $75. So, the total money she earned is 200 + 75 = $275. Adding this to her savings, she has 80 + 275 = $355. The phone costs $400, so she still needs 400 - 355 = $45.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_355, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Height of trees (Changes from 6 feet to 34 feet)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the height of the trees, which we already have, there is no need to consider the density of the trees when calculating the height of the tallest tree.
Solution: First, we find the height of the second tree by adding 5 feet to the height of the shortest tree, which is 6 feet. This gives us 11 feet. Then, we add the heights of the shortest and second tree to get a total of 17 feet. The height of the tallest tree is twice this total, so we multiply 17 by 2 to get 34 feet.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_356, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money Dean has (Changes from $28 to $21)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Dean has left, we do not need to consider his weight or the weight of the toys. The cost of the toys and the additional money his mother gives him are the only relevant factors.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the toys Dean bought. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, which makes 6*2 = $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, which makes 5*1 = $5. The total cost of the toys is therefore $12 + $5 = $17. Dean initially had $28, so after buying the toys he has $28 - $17 = $11 left. His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

        Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money saved, we need to calculate how much Marisa spends each day and subtract that from her daily pocket money. The weight of the coins in the piggy bank is irrelevant to the calculation.
        Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents and she buys 4 of them, so she spends 4 * 25 = 100 cents or $1 on lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so after buying the lollipops, she has $5 - $1 = $4 left each day. If she saves this amount for 5 days, she will have 5 * $4 = $20 in her piggy bank.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_359, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money spent on candy, cost of candy per pound, number of gumballs bought, cost of each gumball
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of candy Billy bought, which can be calculated using the amount of money he spent on candy and the cost of candy per pound. The weight of Billy and the gumballs are irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, he spent $2 on gumballs (0.05*40). This $2 is half of the change he got after buying candy, which means the total change he got after buying candy is $4 (2*2). If he had $10 initially and his change after buying candy was $4, then he spent $6 on candy (10-4). Since each pound of candy costs $1.5, he bought 4 pounds of candy (6/1.5).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_360, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Age of Carver (45 years), Age of son (unknown)
Explanation: The problem deals with the age of Carver's son. The weight of Carver is irrelevant to this problem. We know that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be translated into a mathematical equation to solve for the son's age.
Solution: We set up the equation as 45 = 2x - 5, where x is the age of Carver's son. To solve for x, we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to get 50 = 2x. Then, we divide both sides by 2 to get x = 25. Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken for the trip, which is calculated by dividing distance by speed, there is no need to consider the temperature of the car when calculating the total time.
Solution: First, we need to find out how long each leg of the trip took. The formula for time is distance divided by speed. For the first leg of the trip, John drove 200 miles + 10 miles detour at a speed of 70 mph, so the time taken is (200+10)/70 = 3 hours. For the second leg of the trip, John drove 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph, so the time taken is 240/80 = 3 hours. Adding these two times together, we get a total trip time of 3 + 3 = 6 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_364, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of fourth-grade boys (Changes from 53 to 49)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of fourth-grade boys, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the school when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out the total number of fourth-grade boys in the school by subtracting the number of girls (43) from the total number of fourth-graders (96). This gives us 53 boys. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. So, the number of boys present at school on Friday is the total number of boys (53) minus the number of absent boys (4). This gives us 49 boys.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_365, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of girls (6), Number of boys (2 times the number of girls)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of kids in the park, which is the sum of the number of girls and boys. The number of boys is twice the number of girls. Therefore, the humidity levels are irrelevant to solving this problem.
Solution: There are 6 girls in the park. The number of boys is twice the number of girls, so there are 2*6 = 12 boys. The total number of kids in the park is the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is 6 + 12 = 18.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the points Jane needs to score to pass, her weight is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the points she has already scored and the total points needed to pass.
Solution: Jane has scored 15 points on her first test and 18 points on her second test, which totals to 33 points (15+18). The total points needed to pass is 42. Therefore, Jane needs to score at least 42 - 33 = 9 points on her third test to pass.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_367, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of people kicked out (Changes from 3 to 50)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people kicked out, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of people kicked out for other reasons.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for each reason. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. Four times that number, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting. That's (3*4)-5=7 people. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. That's 3*7=21 people. So, the total number of people kicked out for these three reasons is 3+7+21=31. If a total of 50 people were kicked out, then the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50-31=19.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of points Erin had, which we need to find, there is no need to consider the weight of Erin when calculating her points.
Solution: After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. This means Erin now has 3 * 8 = 24 points. If Erin scored 14 points to reach this total, she must have started with 24 - 14 = 10 points.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_371, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of tennis shoes sold (Changes from 14 to 28 to 14, with 6 returns)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of tennis shoes sold, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the store when counting the total quantity.
Solution: On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. On Saturday, they sold double the amount they sold on Friday, which is 2*14 = 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half the amount they sold on Saturday, which is 28/2 = 14 pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so we subtract 6 from the total. So, the total number of tennis shoes sold is 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returns) = 50 pairs.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of milk collected from the sheep. The weight of the sheep is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg of milk each. So, half of 30 is 15. Therefore, 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each, which totals to 15*1 = 15 kg of milk. The other 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each, which totals to 15*2 = 30 kg of milk. Adding these two amounts together, Mary collects 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pieces of rolls, we don't need to consider Mrs. Sherman's weight. We only need to consider the number of rolls she made and how many she gave to her children.
Solution: First, we find out how many rolls were left after Mrs. Sherman fed her children. Since she made a dozen (12) rolls and gave each of her 6 children one, she had 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. Then, she broke each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she fed to the chickens is 6 * 8 = 48.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pupils who like different colors, we don't need to consider the humidity level. We first find out how many students like blue, which is half of the total number of students (20). Then, we find out how many students like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining students (5). Finally, we find out how many students like yellow, which is the rest of the students after subtracting those who like blue and green from the total number of students (15).
Solution: 
1. Find out how many students like blue: 40/2 = 20 students
2. Find out how many students like green: (40 - 20)/4 = 5 students
3. Find out how many students like yellow: 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 students

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of socks, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the laundry when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate how many socks she has washed. Since a pair of socks consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs of socks would be 10*2 = 20 socks. Adding the 15 loose socks she has washed, we get a total of 20+15 = 35 socks. Now, if there were originally 50 socks that needed washing, and she has washed 35, then the number of socks she has missed is 50-35 = 15.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_380, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Principal amount ($3650), Interest rate (10%), Time period (5 months)
Explanation: As the problem deals with calculating monthly payments, we need to consider the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. Humidity in the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total interest Karan has to pay using the formula for simple interest, which is (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100. Substituting the given values, we get (3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = 1825. This is the total interest she has to pay. We then add this interest to the principal amount she borrowed, which gives us 3650 + 1825 = 5475. This is the total amount she has to pay back. Since she has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide this total amount by 5. So, 5475 / 5 = 1095. Therefore, Karan has to pay $1095 per month.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_381, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance hiked by Cho and Chloe (Cho hiked 112 kilometers and Chloe hiked 45 kilometers)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance hiked by Cho and Chloe, we don't need to consider the temperature when calculating the difference in distance hiked.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many kilometers each person hiked. Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, which is 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, which is 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. So, 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_382, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of silver and gold pesos (Changes from Axel's 130 to Anna's 220)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of pesos, which is the sum of silver and gold pesos, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of pesos Axel has by adding his silver pesos (50) and gold pesos (80) which gives us 130 pesos. Then, we calculate the total number of pesos Anna has. She has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 2*50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which is 80+40 = 120 gold pesos. Adding Anna's silver and gold pesos gives us 220 pesos. Finally, we add the total pesos Axel and Anna have together, which is 130+220 = 350 pesos.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of gifts and the length of ribbon. The weight of the gifts is irrelevant in this case as it does not affect how the ribbon is divided among the gifts.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many gifts in total Monica has to wrap. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these up, we get 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts in total. Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts. So, 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_391, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Ratio of popsicles (5:6), Total number of popsicles (165)
Explanation: The problem deals with the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, and the total number of popsicles they have together. The humidity is irrelevant to the problem as it does not affect the number of popsicles they have.
Solution: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5+6 = 11. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, then each part in the ratio represents 165/11 = 15 popsicles. Therefore, Betty has 5*15 = 75 popsicles and Sam has 6*15 = 90 popsicles. The difference between the number of popsicles Sam has and Betty has is 90 - 75 = 15 popsicles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of subscriptions, the weight of Tim is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract this from the cost of the cable subscription to find out how much Tim saves.
Solution: First, calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% discount. This comes to $10 * 0.8 = $8 each. So, the total cost for both is $8 + $8 = $16. Adding the cost of Netflix, the total cost for all streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26. To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription. This comes to $60 (cable subscription) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

Explanation: The problem deals with the percentage of total work time Carol spent editing. So, we don't need to consider the changes in humidity when calculating the percentage.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total time Carol spent on all tasks. She spent 4 hours writing a song, half of that time (which is 2 hours) recording it, and 90 minutes (or 1.5 hours) editing it. Adding all these times together, we get 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100. So, (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 20%. Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has. We don't need to consider Erica's weight as it is irrelevant to the number of cards she has.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cards Erica has in total. She made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards she has is 20 + 2*15 = 50 cards. Then, we subtract the number of cards she passed out to her classmates and family, which is 24 + 5 = 29 cards. So, she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left. Finally, we add the number of cards she received from family and friends, which is 17. So, the total number of cards Erica now has is 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Mark needs to save to buy a bike. His weight is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out how much more money Mark needs to save to buy the bike. The bike costs $300 and Mark already has $50, so he needs to save an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Mark earns $10 per day, so to find out how many days he needs to work to save $250, we divide $250 by $10. 
Solution: $250 / $10 = 25. So, Mark needs to work for 25 more days to have enough money to buy the bike.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of bugs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the woodshed when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we start with the number of spiders Nancy saw, which is 90. Then, we find the number of millipedes by taking 1/3rd of the number of spiders, which gives us 30. Next, we find the number of stink bugs by taking twice the number of millipedes (60) and subtracting 12, which gives us 48. Finally, we add up all the bugs: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the builder's earnings, the humidity in the work area is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of weeks he works per month, the number of days he works per week, and his daily wage.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many days the builder works in a month. Since he works for 4 weeks every month and for 6 days every week, he works for 4*6 = 24 days in a month. If he gets paid $50 every day, his monthly earnings would be 24*50 = $1200. To find out his annual earnings, we multiply his monthly earnings by the number of months in a year, which is 12. So, 1200*12 = $14400.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of energy saved when reducing the usage of the air conditioner. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the amount of energy saved each day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so if Mel reduces his usage by 5 hours a day, he saves 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watts = 4.5 kilowatts each day. To find out how much energy he saves in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30: 4.5 kilowatts * 30 days = 135 kilowatts. However, the answer provided is 81 kilowatts, which is incorrect based on the calculation.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of stripes on zebras, the humidity in the environment is irrelevant to the calculation of the average number of stripes. 
Solution: First, we find the total number of stripes on the zebras. The two zebras have 17 stripes each, which totals to 34 stripes. The third zebra has 36 stripes. The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes as the third zebra, which is 18 stripes. Adding these together, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. Since there are 4 zebras, we divide the total number of stripes by 4 to find the average number of stripes per zebra. So, 88 ÷ 4 = 22 stripes.

Explanation: The problem involves counting the total number of corns and cannolis. The temperature change in Allan's house is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis and twice as much corn, which means he has 80 corns. After going to the store, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, making the total number of cannolis 100. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which means he bought 20 corns. Adding these to the initial number of corns (80), Allan now has 100 corns. So, the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 (cannolis) + 100 (corns) = 200.

Solution: Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So before his jog, he had completed 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which means he had completed 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps in total. Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_411, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of fireworks (Changes from $400 to $800 to $150), Discount (20%)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost spent, which we already have, there is no need to consider the luminosity of the fireworks when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the fireworks before the discount. Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much, so the second pack costs 2 * $400 = $800. The total cost of these two packs is $400 + $800 = $1200. Then, he also buys a finale firework that costs $150, so the total cost before the discount is $1200 + $150 = $1350. He gets a 20% discount on this, which is 20/100 * $1350 = $270. So, the total amount he has to pay after the discount is $1350 - $270 = $1080.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_412, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies eaten per night (2), number of days (30), number of cookies per recipe (1 dozen)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cookies when calculating the number of dozens she needs to make.
Solution: Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. So, for 30 days, she will eat 2*30 = 60 cookies. Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, she will need to make 60/12 = 5 dozens of cookies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_414, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of blouses (4), Regular price of each blouse ($20), Discount on each blouse (30%)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the discounted blouses. The weight of Misha is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to calculate the discount on a single blouse first, then multiply it by the number of blouses to get the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the discount on a single blouse. The regular price of a blouse is $20 and the discount is 30%. So, the discount on a single blouse is 30% of $20, which is $6. This means the discounted price of a single blouse is $20 - $6 = $14. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost of the discounted blouses is 4 * $14 = $56.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of apples, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount, which is 15, from the shortest trees. This gives a total of 30 + 15 = 45 apples. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples. This gives a total of 60 + 45 = 105 apples. Together, they gather 45 (Joanne) + 105 (sister) = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees. Since the total number of apples gathered is 500, Joanne must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_416, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of heads (180), Number of humps (304)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of camels and dromedaries, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the desert when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. From the problem, we know that C + D = 180 (since each animal has one head) and 2C + D = 304 (since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one). We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get C = 304 - 180 = 124. Substituting C = 124 into the first equation, we get 124 + D = 180, which simplifies to D = 180 - 124 = 56. So, there are 56 dromedaries.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total distance traveled, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total distance.
Solution: First, calculate the distance traveled in the first four days by multiplying the daily distance (200 kilometers) by the number of days (4). This gives us 800 kilometers. Next, calculate the distance traveled in the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 240 kilometers. On the seventh day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance is 0 kilometers. During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, which totals to 2100 kilometers. Add up all these distances to get the total distance traveled: 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers + 0 kilometers + 2100 kilometers = 3140 kilometers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_418, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Size of Peter's locker (5 cubic inches), Size of Zack's locker (1/2 of Timothy's locker), Size of Timothy's locker (unknown)
Explanation: The problem deals with the size of the lockers. The weight of the lockers is irrelevant to the problem as it does not affect the size of the lockers.
Solution: First, we find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, Zack's locker is 4 times as big as Peter's locker. So, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches. Then, we find the size of Timothy's locker. Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 2 times as big as Zack's locker. So, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

Explanation: The problem deals with the elevation of different objects and people on the mountain. The temperature is irrelevant to the problem. We need to find out how much Oliver needs to climb to reach the comb. 
Solution: Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below. So, the comb is now at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. So, to reach the comb, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_420, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money (Changes from $5000 to $17000)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount of money, the temperature at the banks is irrelevant. We only need to consider the amounts given by the banks and the initial capital.
Solution: To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we first need to find out how much money he got from the second bank. Since it's mentioned that the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000, the second bank gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000. Now, we add the money he got from both banks and his initial capital. So, $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000. Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_421, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cats (Changes from 50 to 12)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cats, which we already have, so there is no need to consider the weight of the cats when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we calculate the number of cats that were carried away by the boats. Since each boat carried away 5 cats and there were 4 boats, that's 5*4 = 20 cats. Subtracting this from the initial number of cats, we get 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining. Then, 3/5 of these cats ran after a mouse. That's 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Subtracting this from the number of cats that were left after the boats left, we get 30 - 18 = 12 cats remaining on the rock.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the capacity of vehicles to carry employees, so the weight of the vehicles is irrelevant. To find the total number of employees that can join the trip, we need to multiply the number of each type of vehicle by its capacity and then add those results together.
        Solution: For the buses, 4 buses times 60 employees per bus equals 240 employees. For the minibusses, 6 minibusses times 30 employees per minibus equals 180 employees. For the minivans, 10 minivans times 15 employees per minivan equals 150 employees. Adding these together, 240 employees from the buses, 180 employees from the minibusses, and 150 employees from the minivans, we get a total of 570 employees.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. The humidity in the garden is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Lillian built 3 bird feeders and each of these attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds. So, the bird feeders she built attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds. She also bought 3 bird feeders and each of these attracts 20 birds. So, the bird feeders she bought attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds. Adding these together, Lillian can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_426, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of bagel, soup, and cake.
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of the dinner Aleksandra ordered. The temperature in the restaurant is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out the cost of the soup. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, and the bagel costs $4, we calculate 25% of 4 which is 1. So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5. Next, we find out the cost of the cake. Since the cake costs half the price of the bagel, and the bagel costs $4, the cake costs $4/2 = $2. Finally, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find out the total cost of the dinner. So, $5 (soup) + $4 (bagel) + $2 (cake) = $11.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_427, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cards (Changes from unknown to 150), Money needed (Changes from $0 to $150)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cards Kenny has and the amount of money he needs. The weight of Kenny is irrelevant to the problem. We need to find out how many cards he started with. We know he needs $150 in total and each card is sold for $1.5. He keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. 
Solution: Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and an additional $50 for spending cash, making a total of $150. Since he sells each card for $1.5, he needs to sell 100 cards to get $150. However, he keeps 1/3 of his cards, meaning he sold 2/3 of his total cards. If 2/3 of his total cards is 100, then 1/3 is 50. Adding these together, we find that he started with 150 cards.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of hotdogs prepared and the number of guests. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the number of hotdogs each guest received. 
Solution: The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests with half of them having two hotdogs. This means he prepared 36 + 36/2 = 54 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, meaning he needed 40*2 = 80 hotdogs. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 80 - 54 = 26.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_431, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Money Dora has (Changes from $2 to $18), Cost of items (Total cost is $19)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Dora needs, we don't need to consider Dora's weight. We need to calculate the total amount of money Dora has and the total cost of the items she wants to buy.
Solution: First, we calculate the total money Dora has. She saved $2 and her mother gave her $16, so she has $2 + $16 = $18. Next, we calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2, so the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19. To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the money she has from the total cost of the items. So, $19 - $18 = $1. Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of gasoline needed by Josey to run her lawnmower. The weight of the containers is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15/5 = 3 gallons. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, so each container holds 3*8 = 24 pints. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, so she needed 24/4 = 6 pints of gasoline.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of lollipops each friend received, we only need to consider the number of lollipops and the number of friends. The weight of Ray is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray had left after keeping 5 for himself. This is done by subtracting 5 from the total number of lollipops, which is 25. So, 25 - 5 = 20. Ray then shared these 20 lollipops equally with his four friends. To find out how many each friend received, we divide 20 by 4. So, 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, each friend received 5 lollipops.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the weight of the cake, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the kitchen when calculating the weight of the remaining cake.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much each piece of cake weighs. Since the cake weighs 20 ounces and it's cut into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 20/8 = 2.5 ounces. Rory and her mom each have a piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. The weight of the 2 pieces is 2*2.5 = 5 ounces. To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we subtract the weight of the 2 pieces from the total weight of the cake. So, 20 - 5 = 15 ounces.

Then, since they want to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends), which is 8. So, 56 divided by 8 equals 7. Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_440, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of the room (3 yards), Area of the room (360 square feet)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the perimeter of the room, we need to find the length and width of the room. The temperature change in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the perimeter.
Solution: First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet because the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room is 3*3 = 9 feet. The area of a rectangle is length*width, so the width of the room is 360/9 = 40 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length+width), so the perimeter of the room is 2*(9+40) = 98 feet.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_441, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of bead packs each sister bought (Elizabeth: 1 red, 2 clear; Margareth: 3 blue, 4 red), number of beads in each pack (20)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the difference in the number of beads each sister has. The weight of the beads is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to multiply the number of packs each sister bought by the number of beads in each pack to find out how many beads each sister has. Then, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has to find the difference.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of beads each sister bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, which equals to (1+2)*20 = 60 beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, which equals to (3+4)*20 = 140 beads. Then, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth bought from the number of beads Margareth bought. So, 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_442, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Temperature of the house (Changes from 40 to 49)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the temperature of the house, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the house when calculating the final temperature.
Solution: The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, the temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees. The temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees. Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open, so the temperature decrease due to the window being open is 30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 6 degrees. The final temperature of the house is 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to first find out the total number of eggs she has, then how many glasses of eggnog she can make with those eggs, and finally how many trays she can fill with those glasses. The weight of the eggs and the eggnog is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total. A dozen is 12, so 4 dozen eggs is 4*12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48+2 = 50 eggs. Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50/5 = 10 glasses of eggnog. Each tray holds 5 glasses, so she can put out 10/5 = 2 trays.

Explanation: As the problem deals with points in a game of Scrabble, the humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the points scored by Joey and Marcy.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many points Joey has after his turn. He started with 214 points and scored 26 more, so he now has 214 + 26 = 240 points. Next, we find out how many points Marcy has after her turn. She started with 225 points and scored 10 more, so she now has 225 + 10 = 235 points. To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's total points from Joey's total points. So, 240 - 235 = 5 points.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_448, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sneakers, selling price of sneakers, cost price of sneakers
Explanation: The problem deals with the profit made by the salesman, which is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price. The weight of the sneakers is irrelevant in this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much the salesman earned from selling the sneakers. He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, which gives us 17 * $20 = $340. The rest of the sneakers, which is 48 - 17 = 31, were sold at $25 each, giving us 31 * $25 = $775. So, the total amount he earned from selling the sneakers is $340 + $775 = $1115. The salesman originally bought the sneakers for $576. To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings, so $1115 - $576 = $539.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of crayons, we don't need to consider the weight of the packets when counting the total number of crayons.
Solution: To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we first multiply the number of packets of each type by the number of crayons in each packet. For the packets with eight crayons, she bought 6 packets * 8 crayons = 48 crayons. For the packets with sixteen crayons, she bought 4 packets * 16 crayons = 64 crayons. Adding these together, 48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_450, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of movie ticket ($12), cost of soda ($3), savings ($2), cost of super ticket ($20)
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of different items and savings. The temperature of the theater is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: In order to find the regular price of popcorn, we first need to calculate the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda without the super ticket. We know that the movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3. We also know that without the super ticket, we ended up saving $2. This means that the total cost without the super ticket was $20 (the cost of the super ticket) - $2 (the savings) = $18. So, the cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda was $18. We subtract the cost of the movie ticket and the soda from this total to find the cost of the popcorn. $18 - $12 (movie ticket) - $3 (soda) = $3. Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $3.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of filling balloons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out the initial cost of filling one balloon. We do this by dividing the total cost of filling 20 balloons ($900) by the number of balloons (20). This gives us $45 per balloon. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons, we multiply the number of balloons (170) by the new cost per balloon ($65). This gives us $11050.

Explanation: As the problem deals with average speed, which is total distance travelled divided by total time taken, there is no need to consider the temperature inside the car when calculating the average speed.
Solution: To find the average speed, we first need to find the total distance travelled and the total time taken. The car travels 60 mph for 2 hours, which is 120 miles, and then 30 mph for 1 hour, which is 30 miles. So, the total distance travelled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles. The total time taken is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. The average speed is then the total distance divided by the total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of cards, we do not need to consider the changes in humidity when counting the total quantity of cards. 
Solution: First, we find out how many green cards there are. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate 60% of 15, which is 9. Adding this to the number of red cards, we get 24 green cards. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards, which is 15 + 24 = 39. Adding up all the cards, we get 15 red cards + 24 green cards + 39 yellow cards = 78 cards in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to consider the number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. The weight of the dogs is irrelevant to this problem.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20. Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7. To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100. So, (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles. The weight of the recycling bin is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to calculate the weekly earnings from the cans and bottles and then multiply by the number of weeks in a month.
Solution: Grayson drinks three aluminum cans of soda a week, and each can is worth two cents, so she earns 3 * 2 = 6 cents from the cans. She also drinks five plastic bottles of water a week, and each bottle is worth three cents, so she earns 5 * 3 = 15 cents from the bottles. Therefore, in a week, she earns 6 + 15 = 21 cents from recycling. Since there are four weeks in a month, she earns 21 * 4 = 84 cents in a month.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of cards Miss Maria has and the number of cards each student gets. The weight of the collection is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, which gives us 6*25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, which gives us 5*40 = 200 baseball cards. Adding these together, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. She keeps 50 cards, so she gives out 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_466, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of apples for Becky and Kelly (Changes from $8 to $9)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of apples for Becky and Kelly, there is no need to consider their weights when calculating the difference in cost.
Solution: First, calculate how much Becky paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so that's 20*45 = 900 cents, or $9. She received a $1 discount, so she paid $9 - $1 = $8. Next, calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples. She bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so that's 20*50 = 1000 cents, or $10. She received a 10 percent discount, so she paid $10 - $10*10/100 = $9. Finally, subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total to find out how much more Kelly paid: $9 - $8 = $1.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_468, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of shoes (Changes from 200 to 120)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of shoes, so the weight of the shoes is irrelevant. We need to count the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has after adding and removing certain quantities on specific days.
Solution: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5*2 = 10 shoes. On Wednesday, he gets 15 new pairs, which is 15*2 = 30 shoes. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 30*2 = 60 shoes. So, by Friday, he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left on Sunday.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_469, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of jars of sprinkles (6), cupcakes each jar can decorate (8), cupcakes each pan can hold (12)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pans needed to bake all the cupcakes that can be decorated with the sprinkles. The weight of the jars is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 6 by 8 to get 48 cupcakes. Then, since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes (48) by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold (12) to find out how many pans she needs. 48 divided by 12 equals 4. Therefore, Mary needs to bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all her sprinkles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_470, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of pen ($2), cost of paper ($5), amount given to cashier ($10)
Explanation: The problem involves calculating the change received by Theo. The weight of the pen is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out the cost of the piece of paper. The problem states that it costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, three times the price of the pen would be 3 * $2 = $6. Therefore, the piece of paper costs $6 - $1 = $5. The total cost of the pen and the piece of paper is $2 + $5 = $7. Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is $10 - $7 = $3.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_471, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of students (30), number of pencils each student had at the start of the year (10), proportion of pencils used after two months (1/5), proportion of pencils left at the end of the year (1/3)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pencils left at the end of the year. The humidity in the classroom is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we find the total number of pencils at the start of the year by multiplying the number of students (30) by the number of pencils each student had (10). This gives us 300 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used, so we subtract 1/5 of 300 (which is 60) from 300, leaving us with 240 pencils. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of these remaining pencils were left, so we multiply 240 by 1/3, giving us 80 pencils.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_472, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies (Changes from 2 to 5), Number of carrot sticks (Final answer is 6)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cookies Matt can eat and the number of carrot sticks he needs to eat. Matt's weight is not relevant to the problem, so we can ignore it.
Solution: To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we need to consider the conditions given by his dad. His dad said he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This means that the number of cookies Matt can eat is equal to half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus two. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we can set up the equation 1/2x + 2 = 5, where x is the number of carrot sticks. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives 1/2x = 3. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives x = 6. Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to be able to eat five cookies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the length of the shark and the remoras, not their weight. Therefore, we disregard the weight information. We first convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet, as the shark's length is given in feet. Then, we calculate the combined length of the remoras and find out what percentage of the shark's body length it constitutes.
Solution: First, we convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each 6-inch remora is 0.5 feet long. Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras make up, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. So, (1/10) * 100 = 10%.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of students.
Solution: In the problem, it is stated that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. If 20 students represent this one-fourth, then the total number of students can be found by multiplying 20 by 4. Therefore, there are 80 students in total at that grade level.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time Jason needs to spend each day to break in his shoes. The humidity change is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out the total amount of time Jason has to break in his shoes. He has three weeks until the track tryouts, and he can walk 4 days a week. So, 3 weeks times 4 days per week equals 12 days. Then, we divide the total time needed to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he has (12 days). 240 divided by 12 equals 20. So, Jason needs to walk 20 minutes each day to break in his shoes in time for the track tryouts.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_476, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total amount spent on books ($300), cost of each book ($15), number of kids (4)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of books each child gets. To find this, we first need to calculate the total number of books bought by Sarah. The weight of the bag is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we find out how many books Sarah bought by dividing the total amount she spent ($300) by the cost of each book ($15). This gives us 20 books. Next, we divide the total number of books (20) by the number of kids (4) to find out how many books each child gets. 20 divided by 4 is 5. So, each child gets 5 books.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_477, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of kids (Changes from 9, 6, 3 to 32)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of kids, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the class when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of kids who are allergic to something. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. However, the 3 kids who are allergic to both are being counted twice, once in the dairy group and once in the peanuts group. So, we need to subtract them from the total. This gives us 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12 kids who are allergic to something. Then, to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids in the class. This gives us 32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20 kids who aren't allergic to anything.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of people going on the tour, we only need to consider the number of groups, the number of employees in each group, and the number of tour guides assigned to each group. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the total number of people.
Solution: To find the total number of people going on this tour, we first calculate the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups (3) by the number of employees in each group (200). This gives us 600 employees. Then, we calculate the total number of tour guides by multiplying the number of groups (3) by the number of tour guides assigned to each group (7). This gives us 21 tour guides. Finally, we add the total number of employees (600) and the total number of tour guides (21) to get the total number of people going on the tour. 600 and 21 make 621.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_479, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of plane tickets, Cost of hotel stay (Changes from $1500 to $1800 per day)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay. The weight of Tom is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each ticket costs $5000 and there are two people, the total cost for plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000. Next, we calculate the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, so the cost per day is $1500 * 1.2 = $1800. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400. Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. $10000 + $5400 = $15400.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of paint tubes, we don't need to consider the weight of the paint tubes when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes, Jasper has 4/2 = 2 tubes of blue paint. Next, we find out how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes, Jasper has 3*3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint. To find the total number of tubes Jasper has, we add the number of blue and yellow tubes. 2 and 9 make 11.

Explanation: The problem deals with the combined weight of the two pennies. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the combined weight of the two pennies.
Solution: First, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains. So, we multiply 48 by three-quarters (or 0.75) to get 36 grains. Then, we add the weight of the 1959 penny (48 grains) to the weight of the 2010 penny (36 grains) to get the combined weight of the two pennies. 48 + 36 = 84 grains.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Keegan and Tashay need to earn, the humidity is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider their earnings and their goal.
Solution: To find out how much more they need to earn, we first need to find out how much they have earned so far. We do this by adding Keegan's earnings ($83) and Tashay's earnings ($91) together. This gives us a total of $174. We then subtract this total from their goal of $200. So, $200 - $174 = $26. Therefore, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Stetson gave up, which is dependent on the number of oranges he ate, there is no need to consider the change in Stetson's weight.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we multiply 2/5 by 60 to get 24 oranges. Then, since Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we multiply the number of oranges he ate (24) by $10 to get $240.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of oats needed to feed the horses. The weight of the horses is irrelevant to the solution. We need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in five days and then determine how many bags of oats this equates to.
Solution: First, we calculate how much oats each horse eats in a day, which is 5 pounds per meal times 2 meals, equalling 10 pounds. Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so in total, they eat 4*10=40 pounds of oats per day. If he needs to feed them for 5 days, they will consume 40*5=200 pounds of oats. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben will need 200/50=4 bags of oats.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of individual razors, we need to consider the number of razors and the total cost after applying the discount and coupon. The weight of the razors is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free. This means that for $4.00, Heather can get 2 packs of razors, which is 8 razors in total. She also has a $2.00 coupon, which reduces the total cost to $2.00. Therefore, each individual razor will cost $2.00 divided by 8, which is $0.25 or 25 cents.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_496, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Age of Brett (14 years), Age of Angela in future (3 times Brett's current age), Time difference (4 years)
Explanation: The problem deals with the age of Angela. Brett's and Angela's weights are irrelevant to this calculation. We know that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This allows us to calculate Angela's future age and from there, her current age.
Solution: In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. This means Angela will be 14 * 3 = 42 years old in four years. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 years from 42. So, Angela is 42 - 4 = 38 years old now.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_497, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of days (14), cost of morning ride ($6), cost of afternoon ride ($2)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost spent on driving the car, the humidity is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of days and the cost of each ride.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the morning rides by multiplying the number of days (14) by the cost of each morning ride ($6). This gives us 14*6 = $84. Next, we calculate the total cost of the afternoon rides by multiplying the number of days (14) by the cost of each afternoon ride ($2). This gives us 14*2 = $28. Finally, we add the total cost of the morning rides ($84) and the total cost of the afternoon rides ($28) to get the total cost spent on driving the car during these two weeks. So, 84 + 28 = $112.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_498, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of oranges (Changes from 50 to 120)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of oranges, which is used to determine the number of greek orange pies they can make. The weight of the oranges is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of oranges Ashley and Brianne brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, which is 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, which is 50 + 20 = 70 oranges. So, they have a total of 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 greek orange pies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_500, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of insects (Total is 43, Lily found 7 more than David, David found half of what Bodhi found)
Explanation: The problem involves the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi. The humidity levels are irrelevant to the number of insects found.
Solution: First, let's find out how many insects David and Bodhi found. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as '2x' and the number of insects David found as 'x'. Therefore, the total number of insects David and Bodhi found is '3x'. Given that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects, and Lily found 7 more than David, we can set up the equation 3x + (x + 7) = 43. Solving this equation, we find that x = 9. Therefore, David found 9 insects and Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of yarn used, which we already have. The temperature of the room is irrelevant when calculating the total amount of yarn used.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards. To find out the total yards used, we add Mariah's yards (91) and her grandma's yards (182). 91 + 182 = 273 yards.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. We know that Suzie spent $7 in total, $2 on grape gum and $1 on green apple gum. This leaves $4 for the two packs of strawberry gum. To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by the number of packs.
Solution: Suzie bought four packs of gum and paid $7 in total. She bought a pack of grape gum for $2 and a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. Therefore, she spent $3 on grape and green apple gum. Since she spent $7 in total, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4. Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Explanation: The problem is about maximizing the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make given his budget. The weight of Frederick is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make per dollar spent on each type of wood. For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can make 200 sticks for $4, which is 50 sticks per dollar. For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can make 400 sticks for $6, which is approximately 66.67 sticks per dollar. Therefore, the 2 x 8 wood is cheaper per stick. With $24, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, which will yield 1,600 popsicle sticks.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_506, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of dogs (6), Number of legs per dog (4), Cost per pair of snowshoes ($12)
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of snowshoes for all of Mario's dogs. Each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes is for two legs, so each dog needs two pairs of snowshoes. Therefore, for 6 dogs, Mario needs 2*6=12 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12, so the total cost for 12 pairs is 12*12=$144. The weight of the snowshoes is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs, and each pair of snowshoes is for two legs, each dog needs two pairs of snowshoes. So for 6 dogs, Mario needs 2*6=12 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12, so the total cost for 12 pairs is 12*12=$144.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of Janet's bus trips and how much she could save by buying a weekly bus pass. The temperature in the bus is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week. Since she takes two bus trips five days a week, that's a total of 10 bus trips. Each bus trip costs $2, so she spends 10 * $2 = $20 per week on bus trips. If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would spend the same amount of money, so she would save $20 - $20 = $0. However, the given answer is 2, which seems to be a mistake.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of animals, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out the number of cows and sheep at the zoo. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so it has 2 * 30 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the zoo has 2 * 20 = 40 sheep. Adding up all the animals, the farm has 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 40 sheep = 100 animals. So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo is 50 + 100 = 150.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Julie has left, the changes in her weight are irrelevant. We only need to calculate the amount of money she spent and subtract it from her initial amount.
Solution: First, Julie spent 20% of her $500 on clothes. 20% of 500 is 100 (0.20 * 500 = 100). So, she spent $100 on clothes and had $400 left (500 - 100 = 400). Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. 25% of 400 is 100 (0.25 * 400 = 100). So, she spent another $100 on CDs and had $300 left (400 - 100 = 300).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the house, we don't need to consider the area of the house and lot. We know that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can say that the total cost ($120,000) is made up of 4 parts (3 parts for the house and 1 part for the lot).
Solution: First, we divide the total cost by 4 to find the cost of one part, which is the cost of the lot. $120,000 divided by 4 is $30,000. Therefore, the cost of the lot is $30,000. To find the cost of the house, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3. $30,000 times 3 is $90,000. Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of punches thrown, which is related to the duration of the fight, there is no need to consider the humidity of the room when calculating the total number of punches.
Solution: To find the total number of punches Joe threw, we first need to find the total number of minutes the fight lasted. Since each round is 3 minutes and there were 5 rounds, the fight lasted 3 * 5 = 15 minutes. Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, over the course of 15 minutes, he would have thrown 25 * 15 = 375 punches.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_523, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of loaves of bread (Changes from 200 to 74)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of loaves of bread, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature in the bakery when counting the remaining quantity.
Solution: The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, which totals to 132 loaves sold (93 + 39). A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, which means they had 6 more loaves added to the remaining unsold bread. So, they had 68 loaves left (200 - 132). But with the returned loaves, they now have 74 loaves (68 + 6).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of rows. 
Solution: To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of each color of tulips by the number of tulips he can fit in a row. For the red tulips, we divide 36 by 6, which gives us 6 rows. For the blue tulips, we divide 24 by 8, which gives us 3 rows. Adding these together, we find that Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_525, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total cups of raisins (27 cups), Cups of raisins per batch of cookies (3/4 cup)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, the weight of the raisins is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total number of cups of raisins and how many cups are used per batch of cookies.
Solution: Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide these equally among oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. This means each category will get 27/3 = 9 cups of raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cups of raisins. Therefore, Heather can make 9/(3/4) = 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of CDs Tom could have bought, so we need to consider the cost of the CD and the total amount paid. The weight of Tom is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We know that Tom paid $48 in total, and that the CD cost $4. So, the headphone set must have cost $48 - $4 = $44. Now, to find out how many CDs this amount could have bought, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD. So, $44 / $4 = 11. Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of hours spent working out, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the total time.
Solution: Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for 8 weeks, which totals to 4*8 = 32 hours. However, he worked out for an extra hour for two weeks, adding 2 hours to the total. He also worked out for an extra 2 hours in one week, adding another 2 hours. So, the total time he worked out is 32 + 2 + 2 = 36 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_531, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of passengers (Changes from 48 to 66)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of passengers, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity inside the bus when counting the total number of passengers.
Solution: Start with the initial number of passengers, which is 48. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus, making the total number of passengers 40 + 40 = 80. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers than the number who got off get on. So, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on the bus, making the final number of passengers 59 + 7 = 66.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of the items. The weight of the items is irrelevant to the problem. We are given the cost of the computer and the printer, and the total cost of all items. We need to find the cost of one monitor.
Solution: First, we know that the total cost of all items is $2,400. We also know that the computer cost $1,100. We are told that the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. Since the total cost of all items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors must be $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. Since there are 2 monitors, each monitor must cost $600 / 2 = $300.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of seashells brought by each girl, which is calculated based on the number of seashells brought by boys, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total quantity of seashells brought by each girl.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. We know that each boy brought 60 seashells. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means each girl brought 60 (the amount the boys brought) plus 4*60 (four times the amount the boys brought), which equals 60 + 240 = 300 seashells. Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of Chenny, Alyana, and Anne, there is no need to consider their weights when determining Anne's age.
Solution: First, we find Alyana's age by subtracting 4 from Chenny's age, which is 10. So, Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old. Then, we find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age. So, Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total thickness of the books, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the books when calculating the total thickness.
Solution: To find the total thickness of the four books, we first identify the thickness of each book. The first book is 31 mm thick and the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, which makes it 45 mm (50 - 5). The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it 62 mm (31 * 2). Adding all these together, we get 188 mm (31 + 50 + 45 + 62).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of vlogs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of vlogs required.
Solution: To find out how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to find out how many vlogs she has already made. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Adding these numbers together, we get 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs. To find out how many more she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal. So, 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs. Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money the eldest boy has, there is no need to consider his weight when calculating the total amount.
Solution: First, the $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18/3 = $6. The eldest boy then adds $5 to his share, so he has $6 + $5 = $11. The following day, he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left. Finally, he triples this amount, so he has $13 * 3 = $39.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the change received by Verna, we only need to consider the cost of the fruits and the amount she gave. There is no need to consider her weight when calculating the change.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits. The cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. The cost of the oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. The cost of the peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50. So, the total cost of the fruits is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00. Verna gave $20.00, so the change she received is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the earnings of Jairus and Jenny, the weight of Jairus is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the number of tasks each of them completed and their respective earnings per task.
Solution: First, we calculate how much each of them earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so for 20 tasks, he earns 20 * $0.8 = $16. Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so for 20 tasks, she earns 20 * $0.5 = $10. To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings, which gives us $16 - $10 = $6.

Explanation: In this problem, the weight of Jeff and Brad is irrelevant to the question being asked. The question is about how much money Jeff gets, so we only need to consider the amount of money and how it is divided.
Solution: If Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, then the total amount of money is divided into 5 equal parts (4 parts for Jeff and 1 part for Brad). So, each part is equal to 100 dollars divided by 5, which is 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 parts, he gets 4 times 20 dollars, which is 80 dollars.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_549, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of toys (Changes from unknown to 398)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of toys Jonathan has. The weight of Jonathan is irrelevant in this context. We know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to make a play set five times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys that Jonathan needs is 5 times the number of toys James has, which is 400. But since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this amount, we subtract 2 from 400 to find out that Jonathan currently has 398 toys.
Solution: First, we find out how many toys Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James has 80 toys, five times that amount is 400 toys. However, we know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this amount, so we subtract 2 from 400 to find out that Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_551, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks; Amount Carly gives
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the food and the amount Carly gives. The weight of the food is irrelevant in calculating the change Carly gets back.
Solution: First, calculate the total cost of the hamburgers by multiplying the number of hamburgers (5) by the cost of each hamburger ($4). This gives $20. Then, calculate the total cost of the potato fries by multiplying the number of packs (10) by the cost of each pack ($0.30). This gives $3. Next, calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks by multiplying the number of cans (5) by the cost of each can ($2). This gives $10. Add up these three amounts to get the total cost of the food: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33. Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so to find out how much change she gets back, subtract the total cost from $50. $50 - $33 = $17.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to this calculation. We first calculate the number of bottles Bill already has, then calculate the total number of bottles he needs for his guests, and finally subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number he needs to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy.
Solution: 
1. Calculate the number of bottles Bill already has: 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles.
2. Calculate the total number of bottles he needs: 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles.
3. Subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number he needs: 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles.
Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_555, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Earnings per hour, hours worked per day, days worked per week, savings goal
Explanation: The problem is about how long it will take John to save a certain amount of money. The temperature in his workspace is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works for 5 hours a day, so he earns 2*5 = $10 a day. Then, we calculate how much he earns in a week. He works for 4 days a week, so he earns 10*4 = $40 a week. Now, if he wants to save $80, we divide 80 by his weekly earnings to find out how many weeks it will take him. So, 80/40 = 2 weeks.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_557, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of buttons (21), Number of buttons with two holes (7), Number of buttons with four holes (14)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of holes in the buttons, we don't need to consider the weight of the bag when calculating the total number of holes. 
Solution: First, we find out how many buttons had four holes. We know there were 21 buttons in total and 7 had two holes. So, 21 - 7 = 14 buttons had four holes. Next, we find out the total number of holes. The seven buttons with two holes contribute 7 * 2 = 14 holes. The 14 buttons with four holes contribute 14 * 4 = 56 holes. Adding these together, we get 14 + 56 = 70 holes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cups of coffee Juan drinks, so we don't need to consider Octavia's weight when calculating how many cups Juan needs to reduce his intake by.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks 2 cups (since the daily recommendation is 4 cups). Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so he drinks 20 cups. To reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, Juan needs to reduce his intake by 16 cups (20 - 4 = 16).

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of rodents, which can be calculated by adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. The weight of the rodents is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: To find the total number of rodents, we first calculate the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately. There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so that's 3*10 = 30 hamsters. There are also 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3*5 = 15 guinea pigs. Adding these together, we get 30 + 15 = 45 rodents in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the average weight of the three friends, the temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob.
Solution: First, we find Susan's weight by subtracting 20 from Mark's weight, which gives us 130 pounds. Then, we find Bob's weight by multiplying Susan's weight by 2, which gives us 260 pounds. To find the average weight, we add up the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob, which gives us 540 pounds. We then divide this total by 3 (the number of people), which gives us 180 pounds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_562, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Angle of the sun from the ground (Changes from 32 degrees to 82 degrees)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the angle of the sun from the ground, which we already have, there is no need to consider the luminosity when calculating the total angle.
Solution: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours. So, the total degrees moved by the sun is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees. Adding this to the initial 32 degrees, we get 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees. So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of candles needed and the cost of candles. James' weight is irrelevant to the calculation of the cost of candles.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many candles James needs. His one son is 12 years old, so he needs 12 candles. His other son is 4 years younger, which means he is 8 years old, so he needs 8 candles. In total, James needs 20 candles. A pack of 5 candles costs $3, so to find out how much James spends, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack to get the number of packs needed, which is 4. Then, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of one pack. 4 packs times $3 per pack equals $12.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pages read, which is influenced by reading time and reading speed, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when calculating the total number of pages read.
Solution: In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. If she reads 2 pages per minute, then in one night she reads 15*2 = 30 pages. If we assume a week to have 7 days, then in the first week she read 30*7 = 210 pages. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, in two weeks, she read 210+100 = 310 pages.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sandwiches, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Cody and Trevor when counting the remaining sandwiches.
Solution: Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 12/3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 12/4 = 3 sandwiches. So, Cody and Trevor ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. Since they started with 12 sandwiches, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches.

Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Shiloh and his nephew. The weight of Shiloh is irrelevant to the calculation of the nephew's age.
Solution: In 7 years, Shiloh will be 51 years old (44 + 7). At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, his nephew will be 51/3 = 17 years old in 7 years. To find out how old his nephew is today, we subtract 7 years from 17. So, his nephew is 17 - 7 = 10 years old today.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy. The weight of the tooth fairy is irrelevant to the calculation of the total amount of money.
Solution: First, we know that the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, which totals to $3.00. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that is $0.50. So for the last two teeth, she received $0.50 each, which totals to $1.00. Adding all these amounts together, $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00, we get $9.00.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of goals scored by each teenager, so the temperature is irrelevant. We know that Richie scored 80 goals, and that Mark and Anna scored 20 and 45 goals less than Richie respectively. 
Solution: First, we find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark must have scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna must have scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. To find the total number of goals, we add the goals scored by Richie (80), Mark (60), and Anna (35). So, 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total cost of the kitten so far. The weight of the kitten is irrelevant to the total cost. We need to add up the cost of spaying, the cost of the vaccines, and the cost of the broken vases.
Solution: The spaying cost is $200. Each vaccine costs $20 and there were 3 of them, so the total cost for vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each, so the total cost for the vases is 4 * $12 = $48. Adding all these costs together gives $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_573, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount in savings account (Changes from $3000 to $600)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money in Katina's savings account, which she reduces by $100 every month for 2 years. Her weight is irrelevant to the calculation of the remaining amount in her account.
Solution: Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She removes $100 every month. In a year, there are 12 months, so in 2 years, there are 24 months. Therefore, she removes a total of $100 * 24 = $2400 over 2 years. To find out how much is left in the account, we subtract this amount from the initial amount. So, $3000 - $2400 = $600 is left in the account after 2 years.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the net profit, we need to consider the cost of making the sandwiches and the revenue from selling them. The weight of the food truck is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of making 10 sandwiches. The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 and the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00. So, the total cost is $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00. Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches. Each sandwich is sold for $7.00, so the total revenue is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00. Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit. So, the net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

Solution: First, we need to find out how many utensils Judy brought. She bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes. So, Judy brought a total of 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups + (24 dishes + 20) = 84 utensils. Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money earned by John and Jill, which is directly proportional to the number of hours they worked, there is no need to consider the temperature in the attic and basement when calculating the difference in their earnings.
Solution: First, calculate how many hours each person worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday (2*2=4 hours) and three times as long as Jill on Sunday (1*3=3 hours), for a total of 7 hours. Then, calculate how much each person earned. Jill earned $10 per hour for 3 hours, or $30. John earned $10 per hour for 7 hours, or $70. To find out how much more John earned than Jill, subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings. $70 - $30 = $40.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_586, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Calories burned (Changes from 0 to 1600), Water intake (Changes from 0 to 800 ml)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories she burns. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how many calories Hannah burns in total. She does aerobics for 2 hours, burning 500 calories per hour, so she burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories from aerobics. She also runs for 1 hour, burning 600 calories per hour, so she burns 1 * 600 = 600 calories from running. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 * 100 = 800 ml of water.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_588, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Typing speed (Changes from 47 to 52 to 57)
Explanation: As the problem deals with typing speed, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the average typing speed.
Solution: To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to find out what his typing speed would be after he increases it by 5 words once more. His current speed is 52 WPM, so after increasing it by 5 words, it would be 57 WPM. Now, we add the three measurements together: 47 (his initial speed) + 52 (his speed after the first increase) + 57 (his speed after the second increase) = 156. To find the average, we divide this total by the number of measurements, which is 3. So, 156 divided by 3 equals 52.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, there is no need to consider the room temperature when calculating the weight difference.
Solution: First, calculate how much weight Martin will lose if he eats Cheerios for 5 weeks. 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds. Then, calculate how much weight he will gain if he eats donuts for 5 weeks. 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds. To find the difference in weight between the two options, subtract the weight lost from the weight gained. 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of seats needed, which is directly related to the number of people attending, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when calculating the total number of seats.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people and each of them is bringing 2 friends. So, 100 people invited via email will bring 200 friends (100*2). This makes a total of 300 people (100+200). Then, Alex called 10 of her friends and 8 of them said they will be bringing their spouses. So, 10 friends and 8 spouses make 18 people (10+8). Adding these two groups together, Alex will need 319 seats (300+18).

Solution: First, we find the weight of the Dachshund, which is twice the weight of the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds. Next, we find the weight of the Papillon, which is one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. Finally, we find the weight of the Mastiff, which is 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_592, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of boots and shipping on Amazon and eBay (Changes from $20 to $21)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of boots on Amazon and eBay, the weight of the boots is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total cost on both platforms and then compare them.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both Amazon and eBay. On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping is $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20. On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping is twice as much as it is on Amazon, so shipping is $4 * 2 = $8. Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21. To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Explanation: The problem deals with the growth of the beanstalk and the height of the window. The humidity of the environment is irrelevant to the solution as it does not affect the rate of growth or the height of the window.
Solution: The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. So, on the first day, it will be 8 feet tall. On the second day, it will be 16 feet tall. On the third day, it will be 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground. Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of protein John gets from eating mushrooms, we only need to consider the weight of the mushrooms and their protein content. The volume of the mushrooms is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams would contain double that amount, which is 6 grams of protein. Then, to find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, 6 grams of protein per day times 7 days equals 42 grams of protein per week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_596, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of dental work, deposit paid, hourly wage
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of dental work, the deposit paid and George's hourly wage. The weight of George is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the dental work. The base price of each implant is $2000, so for 2 implants, the cost is 2 * $2000 = $4000. One of the implants has an additional feature, a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900. George makes $15 per hour at work, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to pay for the dental work, we divide the total amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage. So, $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_597, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Angles of the triangle (Smallest angle, angle twice the smallest, angle three times the smallest)
Explanation: The problem deals with the angles of a triangle. The area of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the angles. 
Solution: Let's denote the smallest angle as x. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3x. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180. Simplifying this, we get 6x = 180. Solving for x, we find that x = 30. Therefore, the largest angle, which is three times the smallest angle, is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of legs, we only need to consider the number of each type of pet and how many legs each type typically has. The humidity level is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: In order to find the total number of legs, we multiply the number of each type of pet by the number of legs that type of pet typically has. Dogs and cats each have 4 legs, and birds have 2. So, we multiply 5 (dogs) by 4 (legs per dog) to get 20. We multiply 2 (cats) by 4 (legs per cat) to get 8. We multiply 10 (birds) by 2 (legs per bird) to get 20. Adding these together, 20 (dog legs) + 8 (cat legs) + 20 (bird legs) gives us 48.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of games, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Steve when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In the first year, Steve gets 5 games for his birthday and buys 1 game per month for 12 months, and gets 5 games for Christmas. This totals to 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games. In the second year, he buys 2 games per month for 12 months and gets 5 games for Christmas. This totals to 24 + 5 = 29 games. In the third year, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months and gets 5 games for Christmas. This totals to 48 + 5 = 53 games. So, after 3 years, Steve has 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Howard has left after spending at the arcade. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation as it does not affect the amount of money spent or left. 
Solution: On Monday, Howard spent $8. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as he did on Monday, which is $8 * 2 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is $16 * 4 = $64. The total amount of money he spent is $8 + $16 + $64 = $88. He originally had $100, so after spending $88, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

Explanation: The problem involves finding out how long the tires will last based on the number of rotations they can undergo before needing replacement. The weight of the car is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the number of rotations the car tires make in a month. Given that the car tires rotate 362.5 times every mile, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tires rotate 400 * 362.5 = 145,000 times a month. Now, to find out how many months the tires will last, we divide the maximum tire rotations by the number of rotations made in a month. That is 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months. To convert this into years, we divide by 12 (the number of months in a year), which gives us 72 / 12 = 6 years.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_607, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pumps (120), cost of bottle ($24.00)
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of each pump. The weight of the bottle is irrelevant to the calculation. We first need to find out the number of pumps in the bottle, which is given as 120. We then divide the total cost of the bottle by the number of pumps to find the cost per pump.
Solution: First, we find out how many pumps are in the jumbo bottle. Since the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that, which is 60 washings. Therefore, the jumbo bottle contains 2*60 = 120 pumps. The cost of each pump is then the total cost of the bottle divided by the number of pumps. So, $24.00 divided by 120 pumps gives $0.20 per pump. Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar is 100 cents), we get 20 cents per pump.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Joe will have left after purchasing the clothes, we don't need to consider Joe's weight. The relevant variables are the cost of the clothes, the discount, and the total money Joe has.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount which is $25 + $35 = $60. Then, we calculate the discount by multiplying the total cost by 30% (or 0.30), which is $60 * 0.30 = $18. We subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final price, $60 - $18 = $42. Finally, we subtract the final price from the initial amount Joe had, $50 - $42 = $8.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_614, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of laundry loads per year (104), cost per load ($3.00)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of water for laundry, the weight of Gary is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of laundry loads per year and the cost per load.
Solution: First, calculate how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year by multiplying the number of times he does laundry in a week (2) by the number of weeks in a year (52). This gives us 104 loads of laundry. Next, calculate how much water is used for each load of laundry by multiplying the number of gallons per load (20) by the cost per gallon ($0.15). This gives us $3.00 per load. Finally, calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year by multiplying the cost per load ($3.00) by the number of loads in a year (104). This gives us $312.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_615, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of aquarium, rocks, corals, fish, and fish food
Explanation: The problem is asking for the total amount spent, so we only need to consider the costs of the items purchased. The weight of the aquarium after adding all the items is irrelevant to the total cost.
Solution: First, add the cost of the aquarium to the total cost of the rocks (2 bags at $2.50 each), the corals (3 pieces at $2.00 each), the fish (20 fish at $0.50 each), and the fish food ($2.00). This gives us $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_616, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Height of the beanstalk (Changes from 3 inches to 6 inches to 10 inches)
Explanation: As the problem is concerned with the height of the beanstalk, we do not need to consider the humidity levels when calculating the total height.
Solution: In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 2 * 3 = 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so the total height became 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_617, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of meat sold per day (150kg), Total weight of the bull (750kg)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of meat sold and the total weight of the bull. The temperature in the butcher shop does not affect the amount of meat sold, hence it is irrelevant to the solution.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much meat Prince sells in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, he sells 15kg * 10 = 150kg of meat in a day. Now, to find out how many days it will take for him to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day (150kg). So, 750kg / 150kg = 5 days.

Explanation: The problem is about how many times the DVDs can be played before they break. The temperature of the room does not affect this, so it is not considered in the calculation.
Solution: To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we subtract the number of times each DVD has already been played from the total number of times a DVD can be played. For the first DVD, this is 1000 - 356 = 644 times. For the second DVD, this is 1000 - 135 = 865 times. Adding these together gives 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of therapy, which is dependent on the number of hours spent in therapy and the cost per hour, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of hours John spent in therapy. He went twice a week for 6 weeks, so that's 2*6 = 12 times. Each time, he spent 2 hours, so that's 12*2 = 24 hours. Now, if each hour costs $125, then the total cost would be 24*125 = $3000.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of gum pieces, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the classroom when counting the remaining quantity.
Solution: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day is 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces at school (8 hours / 2 hours per piece). He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, which means he chews a total of 6 pieces (4 at school + 1 on the way home + 1 after dinner). This leaves him with 14 pieces (20 initial - 6 chewed). He then gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, which is 7 pieces (14 remaining / 2). So, he is left with 7 pieces of gum at the end of the day.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of baseballs and basketballs, we don't need to consider the weight of the baseball coach when calculating the difference in spending between the two coaches.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much each coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so 9 * 3 = $27. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so 8 * 14 = $112. To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total: 112 - 27 = $85.

Explanation: The problem deals with converting Ashley's internet speed from kilobytes per second to megabytes per hour. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we convert Ashley's internet speed from kilobytes per second to megabytes per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide 20 by 1000 to get 0.02 Mb per second. Then, to find the speed in megabytes per hour, we multiply this by the number of seconds in an hour (3600). So, 0.02 Mb per second times 3600 seconds per hour equals 72 Mb per hour.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_629, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cars sold (10), cost of each car ($25,000), company's acquisition cost (30%), James' commission rate (10%)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the amount James made, so we do not need to consider the changes in humidity when calculating his earnings. 
Solution: First, we find out how much James made from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so he made 10 * $25,000 = $250,000. The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so they spent 30/100 * $250,000 = $75,000. The profit made is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000. James got a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10/100 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find out the total number of riders who can stay upright. Then, we need to find out the percentage of these riders who are men. The humidity at the beach is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100, which is 25. Then, we find out how many of these riders are men. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, this means that 40% are men. So, we calculate 40% of 25, which is 10. Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of stamps Max bought. The weight of Max is irrelevant to the calculation of the total number of stamps. 
Solution: First, we find out how many truck stamps Max bought. Since he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and he bought 16 snowflake stamps, he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. Next, we find out how many rose stamps he bought. Since he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, and he bought 19 truck stamps, he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. To find out how many stamps Max bought in total, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together. 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the distance between them and their respective speeds. The temperature is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find out the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance that separates them. The distance is 75 miles. The relative speed of Tom to Bob is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph. So, the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob is the distance divided by the relative speed, which is 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of the classes and how many Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. The humidity in the dojo is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much each class costs. We do this by dividing the total cost of the classes ($60) by the number of classes (10). This gives us $6 per class. Then, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. We do this by dividing the total cost of the classes ($60) by $10. This gives us 6. This means that Manny can miss 4 classes (10 - 6 = 4) before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Julie processes twice the number of customers as Jewel, so she processes 100 customers daily. Together, they process 150 customers daily. Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to get the weekly total.
        Solution: Jewel processes 50 customers daily. Julie, working twice as fast, processes 100 customers daily. Together, they process 150 customers daily. Over the course of a week, they process 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time it takes to dig a hole. The volume of the hole and the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth are relevant. The humidity in the air, although it changes, does not affect the time it takes to dig the hole.
Solution: First, we calculate the volume of the hole by multiplying its length, width, and height. In this case, that's 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet. Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth, it will take him 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds to dig the hole.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_640, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of the truck and additional features
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the truck, including the additional features. The weight of the truck is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the cost of the extra features. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500. Adding all these together, the total cost of the extra features is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500. The base price of the truck is $30,000, so the total cost of the truck is $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours which is 54 miles (12 * 4.5). Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours which is 25 miles (10 * 2.5). Adding these together, 54 miles and 25 miles, gives a total of 79 miles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_647, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Digging speed through soil and clay, amount of soil and clay to be dug
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes to dig through soil and clay, the humidity level is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the digging speed and the amount of soil and clay to be dug.
Solution: First, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil. Since Bill can dig 4 feet per hour, and he needs to dig 24 feet of soil, it will take him 24/4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil. Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay. Since Bill can dig half as fast through clay, he digs at a rate of 4/2 = 2 feet per hour. Since he needs to dig 8 feet of clay, it will take him 8/2 = 4 hours to dig through the clay. Adding the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay, we get 6 + 4 = 10 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cupcakes, which is dependent on the number of people and the number of cupcakes per person, there is no need to consider the weight of the cupcakes when calculating the total quantity.
Solution: Howie needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each person in his class. This includes himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, which makes a total of 27 people. So, he needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each of these 27 people. To find the total number of cupcakes, we multiply the number of people (27) by the number of cupcakes per person (2). 27 multiplied by 2 equals 54.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of likes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of likes.
Solution: First, we find out the number of likes after three weeks, which is 70 times the initial number of likes. So, 70 * 2000 = 140000 likes. Then, we add the new likes received recently, which is 20000. So, 140000 + 20000 = 160000 likes. However, we must not forget to add the initial likes received in the first week, which is 2000. So, 160000 + 2000 = 162000 likes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to consider the price of the pomegranates, the number of pomegranates bought and the discount offered. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation of the final prices.
Solution: On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost was 20*20 = $400. She had a $2 voucher, so the final price she paid was 400-2 = $398. On Wednesday, the price per pomegranate was $30, so the total cost for 20 pomegranates was 20*30 = $600. The store offered a 10% discount, so the final price was 600 - 10% of 600 = 600 - 60 = $540. The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is 540 - 398 = $142.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_652, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time of hire (Changes from 5 PM to 9 PM), Cost per hour (Changes from $15 to $30 to $60)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of hiring a carriage, the weight of the carriage is irrelevant. The cost is calculated based on the time of hire and the cost per hour, which increases each hour.
Solution: James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours. The first paid hour is $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour. So, the second hour costs 2 * $15 = $30. The third hour costs 2 * $30 = $60. Therefore, the total cost is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105. However, the original explanation made an error in subtracting the cost of the first hour again. The total cost is already calculated for the hours he paid for, so no subtraction is needed. Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the calculation of Sally's withheld wage, we don't need to consider her weight change. We need to find out how much she actually received this week. We know that her bank account held $200 at the start of the week and now holds $420. This means she received $420 - $200 = $220. If her weekly wage should be $300, then the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.
Solution: Sally's bank account increased by $220 this week ($420 - $200). If her weekly wage should be $300, then the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of eggs needed, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the eggs when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs to make. Since each guest will eat 3 halves and there are 16 guests, Lori needs to make 3*16 = 48 halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 halves, Lori needs 48/2 = 24 whole eggs. Since a dozen is 12, Lori needs 24/12 = 2 dozens of eggs.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pages, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the paper when determining how many pages are left to write.
Solution: Shiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper. She already finished writing 1/3 of the paper. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we first determine how many pages she has already written. 1/3 of 15 is 5. Therefore, Shiela has already written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required. 15 - 5 equals 10. Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost incurred by James in the first year of owning the plane. The weight of the plane is irrelevant to this calculation. The total cost includes the cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel cost.
        Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the plane which is $150,000. Then, we calculate the monthly cost of the hanger and fuel. The hanger costs $5000 a month and the fuel costs twice as much, so it costs $10,000 a month. Therefore, the total monthly cost is $15,000. Over a year, this adds up to $15,000 * 12 = $180,000. Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year. $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Explanation: The problem deals with cooking times, so we do not need to consider the weight of the food. We know the cooking time for rice, the additional time for pork, and that the beans take half the combined time of the pork and rice.
Solution: First, we find out the time it took to cook the pork. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork. Next, we find out the time it took to cook the beans. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes to cook the beans. Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is 30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sheep, which we can calculate using the number of animal legs and heads, there is no need to consider the weight of the sheep when determining the total quantity.
Solution: We know that a sheep has 4 legs and a goose has 2 legs. If we let the number of sheep be S and the number of geese be G, we can form two equations based on the information given. The first equation is S + G = 20 (from the total number of heads) and the second equation is 4S + 2G = 70 (from the total number of legs). Solving these two equations, we find that S = 15 and G = 5. Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_661, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of coffee (Changes from $5 to $6), Quantity of coffee (7 pounds), Cost of donut ($2)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost, we need to consider the cost of coffee and the donut. The weight of Roger is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive coffee costs. Since it's 20% more expensive than the $5 coffee, we multiply $5 by 20% (or 0.2) to get $1. So the more expensive coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he's buying a week's worth, he needs 7 pounds. So the coffee costs $6 * 7 = $42. Adding the cost of the donut ($2), the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of items, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Gus when calculating the cost of the apple pie.
Solution: To find the cost of the apple pie, we first calculate the total cost of the other items. The cost of 2 bags of chips is $2.00 each, which totals to $4.00. The bucket of fried chicken costs $8.00 and the bottle of soda costs $1.00. Adding these together, we get $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00. Since Gus spent $20.00 in total, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount to find the cost of the apple pie. So, $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00. Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00.

Solution: First, we need to find out the total hours John spends in the cooking class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks. So, the total hours spent is 4 (times a week) * 2 (hours each time) * 6 (weeks) = 48 hours. Now, if he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, the total number of recipes he learns is 48 (total hours) / 1.5 (hours per recipe) = 32 recipes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money each person has, there is no need to consider the weight of the individuals when calculating the total amount of money they have and how much each would have if they decided to share equally.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = $90. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = $150. The total amount of money they have together is 120 (Aurelia) + 90 (Kassidy) + 150 (Rayna) = $360. If they decided to share this equally among them, each would get 360 / 3 = $120.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the growth of the bamboo, the humidity is irrelevant to the calculation. The bamboo's current height, its growth rate, and the target height are the relevant variables. 
Solution: First, convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 20 feet equals 240 inches. The bamboo needs to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches, so it needs to grow an additional 600 - 240 = 360 inches. Since the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, it will take 360 / 30 = 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_675, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of toys (Changes from 4 to 21)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of toys, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of James when counting the total quantity.
Solution: James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. When 8 more dogs come to the shelter, he needs to buy 8 more toys, making the total 12. When he comes back, there are twice as many dogs as before, so he needs to buy 12 more toys, making the total 24. When 3 dogs leave the shelter, he no longer needs 3 toys, so the final total is 21.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_676, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total investment amount ($1200), Dylan's investment (2/5 of total), Frances's investment (2/3 of remaining), Skyler's investment (remainder)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money each person invested. The weight of the people is not relevant to the solution. 
Solution: First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. So, Dylan's investment is 2/5 * $1200 = $480. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is $1200 - $480 = $720. Then, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. So, Frances's investment is 2/3 * $720 = $480. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is $720 - $480 = $240. Therefore, Skyler's investment, which accounted for the rest, is $240.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of signatures, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of signatures.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer already have. We do this by adding Carol's 20 signatures to Jennifer's 44 signatures. This gives us a total of 64 signatures. The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the number of signatures they already have (64) from their goal (100). This gives us 36, which is the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_678, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Karen's hourly wage (Derived from Lorie's wage), Karen's daily working hours, Number of days Karen works
Explanation: As the problem deals with how much Karen earns, we need to find out her hourly wage and how many hours she works. The weight of Lorie is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns $10 * 2 = $20 per hour. If Karen works 3 hours per day, in one day she earns $20 * 3 = $60. Therefore, in two days, Karen earns $60 * 2 = $120.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_680, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of adults (9), Weight of an adult (80 kg), Maximum load of the elevator (700 kg)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total weight of the adults and the maximum load of the elevator. The speed of the elevator is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, the total weight of 9 adults would be 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg. The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg. Therefore, to find out by how much they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight. 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg. So, they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_681, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies (Changes for each person)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the people when counting the total quantity of cookies.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, that means Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: Katarina's 68 + Max's 73 + Cookie Monster's 61 + Summer's 96 = 298 cookies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_682, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of the dress (Changes from original to 140cm)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the length of the dress, the weight of Shania is not relevant to the solution. We need to find the original length of the dress before the changes were made.
Solution: To find the original length of the dress, we need to subtract the length of the lace trim (20cm) from the final length of the dress (140cm), which gives us 120cm. This length is 150% of the original length of the dress because Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length. Therefore, to find the original length, we divide 120cm by 1.5, which gives us 80cm.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to mow the lawn, the noise level is irrelevant. We only need to consider the time taken in each mode.
Solution: Chris mows half his lawn in 'turtle' mode which takes 1 hour or 60 minutes. Since he only mows half the lawn, this takes him 60/2 = 30 minutes. He mows the other half in 'rabbit' mode which takes 40 minutes. Since he only mows half the lawn, this takes him 40/2 = 20 minutes. Adding these two times together, Chris spends 30 + 20 = 50 minutes mowing his lawn.

Explanation: As the problem deals with time, we don't need to consider the changes in humidity when calculating how much longer they have to get to school without being late.
Solution: John and Jack have 30 minutes in total. They spent 6 minutes to get to the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, they spent a total of 6 + 13 = 19 minutes. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have. So, 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total amount Catherine pays for the fruits. The temperature inside the store is irrelevant to the total cost of the fruits. 
Solution: Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. To find the total amount she pays, we need to add the cost of all the fruits. The cost of apples is $4. The cost of bananas is 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4. The cost of oranges is 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6. Adding these together, $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies, the temperature of the kitchen is irrelevant. We need to find out how many cookies were baked and then subtract the number of cookies eaten to find out how many are left.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since she bakes twice as many as Greta, who bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 * 30 = 60 cookies. Together, Greta and Celinda bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. If they eat 10 of these cookies, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_687, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Age of twins and triplets (Combined age is 44, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)
Explanation: The problem deals with the age of the twins and triplets, so the weight of the twins is irrelevant in this context. We need to find the age of one of the twins, knowing that the combined age of the twins and triplets is 44 years and one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
Solution: We can assume that the triplet is 'x' years old. This means the twin is 'x + 7' years old. Since there are two twins and three triplets, the combined age can be represented as 2*(x + 7) + 3*x = 44. Solving this equation, we get x = 6. Therefore, one of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with time, which we already have, there is no need to consider the luminosity of the lamp when calculating the total time John has to nap.
Solution: First, we need to convert the 3 hours John has before dinner into minutes, because the homework times are given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Then, we add up the time John needs for his homework: 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history, which totals 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. Finally, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has to nap: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_690, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of coins saved per month by Rong and Neil (Changes from 20 to 28 for Neil)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of coins saved, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the piggy bank when counting the total quantity of coins saved.
Solution: Rong saves 20 coins every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Rong saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins. In ten years, Rong saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins per month than Rong, which is 20 * 2/5 = 8 more coins per month. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. In a year, Neil saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins. In ten years, Neil saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins. Together, Rong and Neil save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins in ten years.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money John leaves with after paying his vet bill. The weight of the dog is irrelevant in this case. We need to calculate the total bill and subtract it from the amount John brought with him.
Solution: 
Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2, the total cost for vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40. 
Step 2: The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, if we let X be the total bill, we have the equation 0.60X = X - $40. 
Step 3: Solving for X, we get X = $100. This means the total bill is $100. 
Step 4: If John brought $125 with him, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

Explanation: The problem asks for the total square footage of Brittany's comforter, which is determined by the total number of 1-foot by 1-foot squares. The weight of the comforter is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we know that there are 14 red squares. The problem states that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. Next, it states that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. Finally, it states that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. To find the total number of squares, we add all these together: 14 red + 18 blue + 24 green + 12 white = 68 squares in total.

Solution: Great Grandma Jones has 3 children. Each of these children has 3 children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren. This means Great Grandma Jones has 3*3=9 grandchildren. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies. So, Great Grandma Jones has 9*3=27 great grand-babies.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the remaining amount of Greta's paycheck after her retirement savings and car payment, there is no need to consider her weight change when calculating the remaining amount.
Solution: First, Greta puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. 50% of $2400.00 is $1200.00. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. 20% of $2400.00 is $480.00. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the money she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck. So, $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 equals $720.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of fireworks, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is setting off. We do this by multiplying the number of boxes (15) by the number of fireworks in each box (20). This gives us 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of these, so we multiply 300 by 0.4 to get 120. Next, we need to add the fireworks Hannah is setting off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so that's 3*5 = 15 fireworks. Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah can see from the city (120) to the fireworks she's setting off in her backyard (15) to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, which is 135.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the weight of gravel each truck can carry, we do not need to consider the volume of the trucks when calculating the weight of gravel Gary's truck can carry.
Solution: First, we know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel and Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which is 4,800 pounds (4,000 + 800). The total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry is 8,800 pounds (4,000 + 4,800). We also know that the total weight that all three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds. So, to find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total weight that all three trucks can carry. This gives us 2,800 pounds (11,600 - 8,800).

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of dumplings Larry cooked. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of dumplings the females ate. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings the females ate is 3 * 6 = 18. Next, we calculate the total number of dumplings the males ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. Since there are 8 males, the total number of dumplings the males ate is 4 * 8 = 32. Finally, we add the total number of dumplings the females and males ate to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked. So, 18 + 32 = 50.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_704, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money Gerald has (Changes from $100 to $60, then to $50)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Gerald has left after spending some, the temperature of the room is irrelevant. We only need to consider the initial amount of money, how it was divided, and how much Gerald spent.
Solution: Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means Gerald got 3/5 of the total amount and Julia got 2/5. So, Gerald got (3/5) * 100 = $60. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_705, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Speed of the cat and turtle (Cat is 5 times faster than the turtle), Time (40 seconds)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance covered by the turtle, the weight of the cat is irrelevant. We only need to consider the speed of the cat and the turtle, and the time for which the turtle is crawling.
Solution: Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second, which is 5 times faster than her turtle. Therefore, the turtle can crawl 15/5 = 3 feet per second. If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it will have crawled 3*40 = 120 feet.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money raised and the time it takes to raise that money. The humidity is irrelevant to the problem as it does not affect the amount of money raised or the time it takes to raise it.
Solution: To find the total number of hours the firefighters have to fundraise, we first need to determine how much money they raise per hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, they are raising $700 per hour ($2100/3). To reach their goal of $6300, we divide the total amount they need to raise by the amount they raise per hour. So, $6300 divided by $700 equals 9 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_707, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Percentage of river's water used by the city (40%), Percentage of city's water used for industrial purposes (80%)
Explanation: The problem deals with the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes. The humidity level of the city is irrelevant in this context. 
Solution: First, we find out how much water the city uses for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water the city uses from the river is for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40, which is 32. This means that 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes. To find out how much is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city. So, 40 - 32 = 8. Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_709, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Quarts of ice cream (Changes from 100 to 50), Time (Changes from 2 hours to 4 hours)
Explanation: The problem deals with the quantity of ice cream produced in a given time. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the total quantity of ice cream produced.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many quarts of each type of ice cream the factory can make in 1 hour. For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so in 1 hour it makes 100/2 = 50 quarts. For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so in 1 hour it makes 50/4 = 12.5 quarts. Therefore, in 1 hour, the factory makes a total of 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts of ice cream. To find out how many quarts the factory makes in 48 hours, we multiply the hourly production by the number of hours: 62.5 * 48 = 3000 quarts.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_710, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number and cost of croissants, cinnamon rolls, mini quiches, blueberry muffins, and discount rate
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of Marcus' purchase. The weight gain after eating is irrelevant to the calculation of the total bill. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of each item separately: 5 croissants at $3.00 each is $15.00, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each is $10.00, 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each is $12.00, and 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each is $13.00. Adding these together gives a subtotal of $50.00. Marcus' loyalty card gives him a 10% discount, so we subtract 10% of $50.00, which is $5.00, from the subtotal. This gives a final total of $45.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_711, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of scoops of ice cream (Changes from 2 to 6), Money available ($6)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of scoops of ice cream Erin can buy. The temperature of the parlor is irrelevant in this case. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every $3 (2 scoops at $1.50 each), Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream. Erin has $6, so she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 additional scoops for free. Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.
Solution: Erin has $6. Each scoop costs $1.50. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. So, for every $3, Erin gets 3 scoops. Therefore, with $6, she can buy 4 scoops and get 2 additional scoops for free. Hence, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_712, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of candy pieces (Changes from 100 to 56 for Ginger and 100 to 58 for Amy)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of candy pieces, we do not need to consider the weight of the candy when calculating the difference in quantity.
Solution: Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. In a day, Ginger eats 4 pieces and Amy eats 3 pieces. This means in a week (7 days), Ginger eats 4*7 = 28 pieces and Amy eats 3*7 = 21 pieces. In two weeks, Ginger eats 28*2 = 56 pieces and Amy eats 21*2 = 42 pieces. To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we subtract the amount Ginger ate from the amount Amy ate. So, 56 - 42 = 14. Therefore, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tiles needed to cover a certain area of the bathroom. Mr Boarden's weight is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out the area of the bathroom that Mr Boarden wants to cover with mosaic tiles. Since he wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we multiply 36 by 2/3 to get 24 sq ft. Next, we multiply this area by the number of tiles needed per square foot, which is 24. So, 24 sq ft times 24 tiles equals 576 tiles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the number of eggs, amount of cheese and ham, and their respective calorie counts. The weight of John is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham. John uses 6 eggs, each of which is 75 calories, so the eggs contribute 6*75 = 450 calories. He also uses 2 oz of cheese, each of which is 120 calories, so the cheese contributes 2*120 = 240 calories. Finally, he uses 2 oz of ham, each of which is 40 calories, so the ham contributes 2*40 = 80 calories. Adding these together, we get 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_717, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of pencils and erasers, number of pencils and erasers bought, total money paid
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of pencils and erasers and the total money paid, the weight of the pencils and erasers is irrelevant in this context. We need to calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers bought and subtract it from the total money paid to find out the change.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers. The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00. The total cost of the pencils and erasers is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00. If you paid with a $10 bill, then the change you would receive is $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of boxes of cereal, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cereal when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we first need to find out how many boxes she bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which totals to 8 boxes (3+5). Last week, she bought 4 boxes. So, the difference between this week's and last week's purchases is 8 - 4, which equals 4.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself. The weight of the car and the asphalt are irrelevant in this calculation.
Solution: First, calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself. This includes the fine from the city council ($120) and the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets * $25 each = $75). So, the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself is $120 + $75 = $195. Then, compare this to the cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed, which is $450. The difference between these two amounts is how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself: $450 - $195 = $255.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chairs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the luminosity of the restaurant when counting the total quantity.
Solution: The restaurant initially had 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, which totals to 193 chairs. If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, that's a total of 33 chairs sent for repair. To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair (33) from the total number of chairs the restaurant initially had (193). So, 193 - 33 equals 160.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of pizza slices left after some were eaten. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the number of pizza slices. 

Solution: Initially, there were 5 pizzas, each with 12 slices, totaling 5*12 = 60 slices. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is 2/3*12 = 8 slices each, so together they ate 3*8 = 24 slices. The remaining two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 3/4*12 = 9 slices each, so together they ate 2*9 = 18 slices. In total, they ate 24+18 = 42 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is the initial number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is 60-42 = 18 slices.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the percentage of blue spools, we need to find the total number of spools and the number of blue spools. The weight of the spools is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has. This is done by adding the number of light blue spools (15), dark blue spools (45), light green spools (40), and dark green spools (50). This gives us a total of 150 spools. Next, we find the total number of blue spools, which is the sum of light blue spools (15) and dark blue spools (45), giving us 60 blue spools. To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools (60) by the total number of spools (150) and multiply by 100. This gives us 40%.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of packs of gum needed for 30 days, we do not need to consider Parker's weight. We only need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days and then determine how many packs of gum this equates to.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. Since he chews 4 pieces a day, we multiply 4 by 30 to get 120 pieces. Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need. Since each pack has 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces (120) by the number of pieces in each pack (15). This gives us 8 packs of gum.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of smores needed and how many smores can be made from a box of graham crackers. The weight of the graham crackers is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. For the kids, each kid wants 2 smores, so for 9 kids, we need 9*2 = 18 smores. For the adults, each adult will eat 1 smore, so for 6 adults, we need 6*1 = 6 smores. Adding these together, we get a total of 18+6 = 24 smores needed. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box, so one box makes 8*3 = 24 smores. Since we need 24 smores, and one box makes 24 smores, we will need 1 box of graham crackers.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total weight of the books, we don't need to consider the volume of the books in the bag. The weight of the history book is twice the weight of the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. Now, we just need to add the weights of all the books.
Solution: Math book (2 pounds) + Science book (2 pounds) + French book (4 pounds) + English book (3 pounds) + History book (6 pounds) = 17 pounds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_735, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of votes for candidate A (20), Number of votes for candidate B (30), Total number of voters (100)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of votes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total votes.
Solution: First, we find out how many votes candidate A got. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, candidate A got 20 votes (20% of 100). Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, which means candidate B got 30 votes (50% more of 20). Therefore, candidate A and B together got 50 votes (20 + 30). Since all the remaining votes were given to candidate C, candidate C also got 50 votes (100 - 50).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of apples, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the apples when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck starts with 23 fewer apples than Boris, which is 100 - 23 = 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples. The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transfer is 100 - 87 = 13 apples. So, Beck has 13 fewer apples than Boris now.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_737, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of water (Changes from 32 ounces to 2 ounces)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when calculating the remaining water.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes. Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water, so 3 giant cubes use 3 * 4 = 12 ounces. Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, so 7 medium cubes use 7 * 2 = 14 ounces. Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water, so 8 small cubes use 8 * 1/2 = 4 ounces. So, the total amount of water used is 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. Peter started with 32 ounces of water, so he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water left.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of books, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the individuals when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we know that Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, Steven must have 20/2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of Alice's books from Clara's. So, 20 - 16 = 4.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_742, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total number of students (80), Percentage of girls in each class (40%)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of boys in each class, so we don't need to consider the humidity levels. We first find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2. Then, we find the number of girls in each class by multiplying the number of students in each class by the percentage of girls. Finally, we find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
Solution: 
1. Find the number of students in each class: 80 (total students) ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class.
2. Find the number of girls in each class: 40 (students in each class) x 0.4 (percentage of girls) = 16 girls in each class.
3. Find the number of boys in each class: 40 (students in each class) - 16 (girls) = 24 boys in each class.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of animals Melissa needs to groom, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the place when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to find the total number of animals she needs to groom. This is done by adding the number of dogs (8), cats (5), birds (3), and horses (12). This gives us a total of 28 animals. Since there are 7 days in a week, we then divide the total number of animals (28) by the number of days in the week (7). This gives us 4 animals per day.

Explanation: The problem deals with the profit Mark made from selling the cards. The weight gain from handling the cards is irrelevant to the calculation of profit. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the packs Mark bought. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so 3 * 1800 = $5400. Then, we calculate the total value of the cards he got. He got 1 card worth $4000, another worth $1000, and 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each, so 4000 + 1000 + (30 * 50) = $6500. The profit is the total value of the cards minus the cost of the packs, so 6500 - 5400 = $1100.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the amusement parks, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity at the parks when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the cost for the first amusement park: 2 adults * $26/adult + 2 children * $12/child = $52 + $24 = $76. Then we calculate the cost for the second amusement park: 2 adults * $14/adult + 2 children * $10/child = $28 + $20 = $48. To find out how much they can save, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first: $76 - $48 = $28.

Explanation: The problem is about the money saved by the vendor per week. The weight of the tomatoes is irrelevant to the calculation of the money saved. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the vendor saves per tomato. He used to buy them for $.5 each and now he buys them for $.4 each. So, he saves $.5 - $.4 = $.1 per tomato. He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he saves $.1 * 500 = $50 a day. There are 7 days in a week, so he saves $50 * 7 = $350 a week.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of marbles, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Carl when counting the total quantity of marbles.
Solution: First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles. To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles (224) and Cal's marbles (112). 224 + 112 = 336.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of groups, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the number of groups needed.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many groups have already been formed. Since fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size, this means 54 divided by 6 equals 9. So, 9 students per group. If the activity requires 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups already formed (6) from the total number of groups needed (12). This gives us 12 - 6 = 6. Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of chairs rented out, so the weight of the chairs is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months. 
Solution: In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So, in a week, Candy rents out 60 chairs per day for 5 days and 100 chairs per day for 2 days. That's (60*5) + (100*2) = 300 + 200 = 500 chairs in a week. In a month of 4 weeks, she rents out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs. Therefore, in two 4-week months, she rents out 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of electricity per roommate per year, the area of the apartment is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of roommates and the monthly electricity bill.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much each roommate pays per month. Since the electricity bill is $100 and there are 5 roommates (including Jenna), each roommate pays $100/5 = $20 per month. To find out how much each roommate pays per year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year. So, $20 * 12 = $240. Therefore, each roommate pays $240 per year for electricity.

Explanation: The problem involves the number of votes in favor of a new regulation. The humidity level in the room is irrelevant to the voting process and can be ignored. The number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. If we represent the votes against as 'x', then the votes in favor are '2x'. The total number of votes (33) is the sum of votes in favor and votes against, which can be represented as 'x + 2x = 3x'.
Solution: We can set up the equation 3x = 33 to represent the total number of votes. Solving for 'x' gives us 'x = 11'. Therefore, the number of votes in favor, which is '2x', is 2*11 = 22.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of shirts Krissa needs to order, the temperature is irrelevant to the solution. We need to calculate the number of shirts needed for each size and then add them up to get the total number of shirts.
Solution: We start by identifying the number of students who need each size. We know that 11 students need size extra-small. Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so that's 2*11 = 22 students. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so that's 22-4 = 18 students. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so that's 18/2 = 9 students. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so that's 9+6 = 15 students. To find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up all these numbers: 11+22+18+9+15 = 75 shirts.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we do not need to consider his weight change. We only need to calculate the difference between the cost of the camera and the money Jayden has.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Jayden has in total. He initially had $70 and his sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract what he already has from the cost of the camera. So, $200 - $115 = $85. Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_763, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cases of shingles (Changes based on the house)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cases of shingles needed for the houses, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity level when calculating the quantity.
Solution: Let's denote the number of cases needed for the second house as x. According to the problem, the first house needs 1/2 of what the second house needs, so the first house needs 1/2x cases. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so the third house needs 2*(1/2x) = x cases. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250, so we have the equation 1/2x + x + x = 250. Solving this equation gives x = 100. Therefore, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount spent, which is based on the number of items bought and their respective prices, there is no need to consider the weight of the items when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much each person spent. Leila spent $2 per cucumber and bought 3 cucumbers, so she spent 2*3 = $6. Jack spent $1 per tomato and bought 5 tomatoes, so he spent 1*5 = $5. Chase spent $3 per lettuce and bought 1 lettuce, so he spent 3*1 = $3. To find the total amount spent, we add the amounts spent by each person. So, 6 (Leila) + 5 (Jack) + 3 (Chase) = $14.

Explanation: Since the problem deals with the number of fruits, we don't need to consider George's weight. We first need to calculate the number of pears George has. Since he has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we calculate 45% of 200, which is 90. So, George has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 fruits. To find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears together.
Solution: First, we calculate 45% of 200 bananas, which is 90. So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Hence, he has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 fruits. Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and pears together. So, 200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_766, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money Marissa had ($80), cost of the ball ($20), cost of candy bars ($5 each)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of candy bars Marissa could buy. The weight of the ball is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball and then divide that by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many she could buy.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball. Since she had $80 and spent $20 on the ball, she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. Candy bars are sold at $5 each, so to find out how many candy bars Marissa could buy, we divide the remaining money by the price of one candy bar. $60 / $5 = 12. Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of making juice, we need to consider the quantity of juice, the quantity of oranges required, and the cost of oranges. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters would require 4*5 = 20 kilograms of oranges. Next, we need to find out how much 20 kilograms of oranges would cost. Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, 20 kilograms would cost 20*3 = $60.

Explanation: The problem deals with Tanya's earnings, which are calculated based on the number of hours she works and whether she teaches more than 3 classes in a day. The humidity levels are irrelevant to her earnings and can be ignored.
Solution: First, we calculate how much Tanya earns per day based on her hourly rate. On Monday, she works for 5 hours, so she earns 5 * $15 = $75. On Wednesday, she works for 2 hours, so she earns 2 * $15 = $30. Then, we add the additional $5 she earns on Monday for teaching more than 3 classes. So, her total earnings for these two days are $75 (Monday) + $5 (additional for Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of scents sold, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the difference in sales.
Solution: To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we first need to find out the total number of each type of scent sold. The company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, which gives us 5*4 = 20 vanilla scents sold. They also sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, which gives us 2*8 = 16 fruity scents sold. To find the difference, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold, which gives us 20 - 16 = 4 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount Bennet needs to make from selling his produce. The weight of the eggplants is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to calculate how much he makes from selling his eggplants, subtract that from his total desired income to find out how much he needs to make from selling corn, and then divide that by the number of ears of corn to find out how much each should be sold for.
Solution: First, we calculate how much Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from selling eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135, so the amount he needs to make from selling corn is $135 - $60 = $75. He has 25 ears of corn to sell, so each ear of corn should be sold for $75 / 25 = $3.

Explanation: The problem deals with the distribution of Tatiana's time over the weekend. The humidity in her room is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out how much time she spends playing soccer, which is the remaining time after reading and playing video games.
Solution: Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, giving her a total of 12 hours over the weekend. If she reads for 3 hours, she has 9 hours left. She then plays video games for 1/3 of this time, which is 3 hours. This leaves her with 6 hours for soccer. The percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer is therefore (6/12)*100 = 50%.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total time Jack is away from home. The temperature at home and at the museum are irrelevant to this calculation. We need to calculate the time taken to drive to and from the museum and add the time spent at the museum.
Solution: First, we calculate the time it takes Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at 75 mph, so the time it takes him to get there is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. Since he drives there and back, the total driving time is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours. Then, we add the time he spends at the museum (6 hours) to the total driving time. So, 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours. Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of wheels needed for assembling cars and motorcycles, and the number of wheels left after the assembly. The weight of Henry is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels needed for all the cars and motorcycles. For the cars, we multiply the number of cars (57) by the number of wheels each car needs (4), which gives us 228 wheels. For the motorcycles, we multiply the number of motorcycles (73) by the number of wheels each motorcycle needs (2), which gives us 146 wheels. Adding these two amounts together, we find that Henry needs a total of 374 wheels to assemble all the toys. If he starts with a box of 650 wheels, and uses 374 of them, he will be left with 276 wheels.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of replacing movies. The weight of the collection is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to calculate the cost of replacing series movies, older movies, and normal movies separately and then add them up.
Solution: 
1. Calculate the number of series movies: 600/3 = 200 movies. The cost for these is 200 * 6 = $1200.
2. Calculate the number of older movies: (600 - 200) * 0.4 = 160 movies. The cost for these is 160 * 5 = $800.
3. Calculate the number of normal movies: 600 - 200 - 160 = 240 movies. The cost for these is 240 * 10 = $2400.
4. Add up all the costs: 1200 + 800 + 2400 = $4400.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total distance to the vacation spot, which can be calculated by adding the distance driven and the distance hiked. The temperature change is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: 
1. Calculate the time spent driving: Total time - Time spent hiking = 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours
2. Calculate the distance driven: Time spent driving * Speed of driving = 4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour = 225 miles
3. Calculate the speed of hiking: Half the speed of driving - 5 miles/hour = (50/2) - 5 = 20 miles/hour
4. Calculate the distance hiked: Time spent hiking * Speed of hiking = 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles
5. Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot: Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles

Solution: Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which equals 3 rides * 5 days = 15 rides. On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, which equals 2 * (3 rides * 2 days) = 12 rides. Adding these together, we get 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides. However, since there are two of them (Chase and Rider), we multiply the total rides by 2, which equals 27 rides * 2 = 54 rides.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the number of fish, specifically the number of white fish Bob bought at the store. The volume of the pond is irrelevant to this calculation. 
        Solution: Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, 3 of which were orange and 4 were white. After buying 17 more fish, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means that the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish. If we subtract the initial number of orange fish (3) from the total number of orange fish, we get the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store. If we subtract this number from the total number of fish Bob bought at the store (17), we get the number of white fish Bob bought at the store. Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of fuel for Andy's weekly commute. The temperature in the garage is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: 
Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he travels to and from work, the total distance per day is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. 
Step 2: As he travels from Monday to Friday, the total distance per week is 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles. 
Step 3: Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, he will need 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas per week. 
Step 4: At a price of $3 per gallon, the total cost per week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we do not need to consider the humidity in the garden when calculating the total yield.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total yield of each type of plant. For the tomato plants, we multiply the number of plants (5) by the yield per plant (22), which gives us 110 tomatoes. For the eggplant plants, we multiply the number of plants (8) by the yield per plant (4), which gives us 32 eggplants. To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes (110) and eggplants (32). 110 and 32 make 142.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_787, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of TVs (Changes from 40 to 25)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of TVs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the store when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold. Since one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs, we multiply 40 (total TVs sold) by 1/4, which gives us 10 smart TVs. Similarly, since one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs, we multiply 40 by 1/8, which gives us 5 analog TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total. So, 40 (total TVs) - 10 (smart TVs) - 5 (analog TVs) = 25 OLED TVs.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money John is missing for his trip, his weight is irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the total cost of the trip, the amount John has, and the school's contribution.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the school is covering. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we divide the total cost of the trip ($300) by 2, which gives us $150. This is the amount the school is covering. Then, we subtract the amount John has ($50) from the amount the school is covering ($150). $150 - $50 gives us $100. So, John is missing $100 to cover the cost of the trip.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_789, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Temperature during the day (45 degrees), Temperature change from day to night (-33 degrees), Temperature increase per log burned (5 degrees)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing. The humidity change is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out the temperature during the night, which is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. Then we calculate the temperature difference needed to reach 32 degrees, which is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Finally, we divide this temperature difference by the temperature increase per log burned to find out the number of logs needed.
Solution: First, we find the temperature during the night: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. Then, we calculate the temperature difference needed to reach 32 degrees: 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Finally, we divide this temperature difference by the temperature increase per log burned: 20 / 5 = 4 logs. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of seashells brought back by a fraction of the groups. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we find the total number of groups by dividing the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9). This gives us 10 groups. Then, we find the number of groups that each brought back 2 seashells by multiplying the total number of groups (10) by 3/5. This gives us 6 groups. Finally, we find the total number of seashells by multiplying the number of groups that brought back seashells (6) by the number of seashells each group brought back (2). This gives us 12 seashells per group. Since there are 6 such groups, the total number of seashells is 12*6 = 72.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_791, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of people on the train (Changes from 172 to 100)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people on the train, which we already have, there is no need to consider the speed of the train when counting the total number of people.
Solution: In order to find the total number of people on the train, we start with the initial number of people on the train (172). At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172 to get 125. Then, 13 people get on, so we add 13 to 125 to get 138. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138 to get 100.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total number of lions in the enclosure. The humidity level is irrelevant to the number of lions, so we can ignore it.
Solution: To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions, this means there are 12/2 = 6 male lions. There are also 14 lion cubs. Adding these together, 12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs gives us 32 lions in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_795, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Original price of jeans ($40), Discount on jeans (25%), Amount paid with ($50)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans. The weight of Mike is irrelevant to the solution. We need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans and then subtract it from the amount Mike pays with.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the jeans cost after the 25% discount. To do this, we multiply the original price of the jeans ($40) by 25% (or 0.25). This gives us $10. We then subtract this amount from the original price to get the discounted price, which is $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the cost of the jeans from the amount he paid with. $50 - $30 equals $20, which is the amount of money Mike will have left over.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of money the company pays to its employees. The number of employees and their salary are relevant to this calculation. The change in humidity is not relevant to the calculation of the total salary paid by the company.
Solution: The company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the company would have hired 20 * 3 = 60 new employees. Adding these to the initial number of employees, the total number of employees becomes 200 + 60 = 260. Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is 260 employees * $4000/employee/month * 3 months = $3120000.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total caroling time, which can be determined by the number of times each song is sung and the duration of each song. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add up the total time for each song. Since 'Deck the Halls' is sung twice, we multiply its length (150 seconds) by 2, which gives us 300 seconds. Then we add the length of 'Jingle Bells' (240 seconds) to this. So, 300 seconds + 240 seconds equals 540 seconds.

Explanation: The problem deals with the earnings of Billy and Sally. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of their earnings. The important variables are their hourly rates and the number of hours they work.
Solution: Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50, making his hourly rate $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00, making his new hourly rate $11.50. If Billy works 20 hours, he will earn 20 * $11.50 = $230. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary, which makes it $10.50 per hour. If Sally works 20 hours, she will earn 20 * $10.50 = $210. Therefore, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of bread and bagels, we do not need to consider the weight of these items when calculating the difference in cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread by multiplying the cost of one loaf ($2) by 3, which gives us $6. Next, we calculate the cost of 2 bagels by multiplying the cost of one bagel ($1) by 2, which gives us $2. To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread. $6 - $2 = $4.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of trees planted, which is determined by the number of students and teachers and the number of trees each one plants. The humidity change is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, calculate the total number of students and teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students and 3 teachers per class, so there are 40*25 = 1000 students and 40*3 = 120 teachers. Each student plants 1 tree and each teacher plants 2 trees, so the students will have planted 1000*1 = 1000 trees and the teachers will have planted 120*2 = 240 trees. Adding these together, they will have planted 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total hours of play, which we already have, there is no need to consider the volume of the game when calculating the total hours of play.
Solution: Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she plays 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours in two weeks. Then, she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. So, she plays 7 * 2 = 14 hours in one week. In total, she plays 7 + 14 = 21 hours. To earn the achievement, she needs to play 30 hours. So, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance between the two cars, which is dependent on their speeds and the time they are driving, there is no need to consider the temperature on the highway.
Solution: In order to find the distance that separates the two cars after 2 hours, we subtract the speed of the first car from the speed of the second car (70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph). This gives us the relative speed of the second car compared to the first. Then, we multiply this relative speed by the time they are driving (10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles). So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of glass chips and the size of the mosaic. The weight of the glass chips is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, he has 72 * 2 = 144 glass chips. Next, we need to find out how many square inches of mosaic he can make with these chips. Since it takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, he can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches of mosaic. Finally, since he wants his mosaic to be three inches tall, we divide the total square inches by the height to find the length. So, 12 / 3 = 4 inches long.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the quantity of tea, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the room when calculating the total quantity of tea.
Solution: First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, which totals to 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea, which totals to 16 * 2 = 32 quarts. Add these two amounts together to get the total amount of tea consumed: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. Now, add the amount of tea left over from the party (10 quarts) to the amount consumed to find the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party: 38 + 10 = 48 quarts. Since 1 gallon is equivalent to 4 quarts, divide the total quarts by 4 to convert it to gallons: 48 / 4 = 12 gallons.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which doubles every month, there is no need to consider the humidity on campus when calculating the additional number of students. 
Solution: In order to find the total number of students on campus by the end of May, we need to calculate how many times the number of students doubles from the beginning of the year to the end of May. As the number of students doubles every month, by the end of January there would be 10*2=20 students, by the end of February there would be 20*2=40 students, by the end of March there would be 40*2=80 students, by the end of April there would be 80*2=160 students and by the end of May there would be 160*2=320 students. To find the additional students who have joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May. So, 320-10=310 additional students would have joined by the end of May.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the average number of branches climbed per day, we don't need to consider the temperature changes during the week. We only need to consider the total money earned, the cost per branch climbed, and the number of days in a week.
Solution: Felix made $105 in a week by climbing trees. Each branch he climbed cost $.25. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide the total amount he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($.25). This gives us 420 branches. However, since we want to find out the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide this total by the number of days in a week (7). 420 divided by 7 gives us 60 branches per day on average.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of petals, so we don't need to consider the weight of the flowers. We need to calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked, and then subtract the number of petals on the flowers she dropped.
Solution: First, calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each (3*5=15), 4 flowers with 6 petals each (4*6=24), 5 flowers with 4 petals each (5*4=20), and 6 flowers with 7 petals each (6*7=42). The total number of petals is 15+24+20+42=101. However, she dropped 1 of each flower, so we subtract the number of petals on each of these flowers from the total. The number of petals on the dropped flowers is 5+6+4+7=22. So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 101-22=79.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of marshmallows and how many s'mores can be made with the remaining marshmallows. The weight of the bag is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: John and DeSean start with 35 marshmallows. John uses 9 marshmallows to make s'mores and DeSean also uses 9 marshmallows to make s'mores. This totals to 18 marshmallows used (9+9). They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or wasted is 21 (18+3). They started with 35 marshmallows, so if we subtract the 21 marshmallows that were used or wasted, we get 14 marshmallows left (35-21). Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 more S'mores. If we divide this by the 2 kids, each kid can make 7 more S'mores (14/2).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money used, which is determined by the number of quarters used, there is no need to consider the temperature inside the arcade when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we need to determine how many quarters each person uses. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, so in 4 hours (240 minutes), he uses 240 / 20 = 12 quarters. His two friends who are worse than him can only play half as long, so they use 2 * (240 / (20 / 2)) = 24 quarters. His friend who is better can play 1.5 times as long, so he uses 240 / (20 * 1.5) = 8 quarters. In total, they use 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they use 44 * $0.25 = $11.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of ingredients used to make the salt scrub. The weight of the ingredients is irrelevant to determining the amount of oil used. Instead, we need to focus on the relationships between the amounts of the different ingredients.
Solution: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x. Since the amount of salt and sugar is the same and it's twice as much as the zest, it's 2x. The amount of oil is twice as much as the salt, so it's 2*2x = 4x. The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, so x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10. Solving this equation gives x = 1. So, the amount of oil is 4x = 4*1 = 4 ounces.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount of money spent, which is calculated by the number of animals bought and their respective prices, there is no need to consider the weight of the goods in the market.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the goats by multiplying the number of goats (3) by the cost of each goat ($500). This gives us 3 * $500 = $1500. Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows by multiplying the number of cows (2) by the cost of each cow ($1500). This gives us 2 * $1500 = $3000. Finally, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money spent. $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_817, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cupcakes (Changes from 48 to 63)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cupcakes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Paul when calculating the total quantity of cupcakes needed.
Solution: To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we subtract the total number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs. Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which makes a total of 48 cupcakes (8 + 40). He needs 63 cupcakes in total. So, 63 - 48 equals 15. Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_818, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cars (Changes from 40 to 16)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cars, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cars when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars. Joe then sells 20% of his cars, which is 20/100 * 40 = 8 cars. So, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars. Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars. So, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_819, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Total money raised ($175,000), money from organizations ($50,000), number of students (20)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money each student raised. The weight of the money is irrelevant to the calculation. First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. We subtract the amount from organizations from the total amount raised. Then, we divide this total by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.
Solution: The total amount raised is $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations. So, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000. Since each student raised the same amount, we divide this total by the number of students, which is 20. So, $125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250. Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_823, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Sasha's scores in both games (Changes from 14 to 4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with Sasha's total points, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity levels during the games when calculating the total points.
Solution: In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game, which means Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game. The total points Sasha scored in both games is the sum of the points she scored in the first and second game, which is 14 (from the first game) + 4 (from the second game) = 18.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of tins of cat food and dog food, there is no need to consider the weight of Kimberly when calculating the difference in the quantity of cat food and dog food tins.
Solution: First, we find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought by multiplying the number of packages (8) by the number of tins in each package (11). This gives us 88 tins of cat food. Next, we find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought by multiplying the number of packages (6) by the number of tins in each package (6). This gives us 36 tins of dog food. To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins. 88 minus 36 equals 52.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of eggs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the park when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Cindy had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, she had 2*5 = 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10-1 = 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9/3 = 3 yellow eggs. In total, Cindy had 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the number of chocolate bars produced each week, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the factory when calculating the total production.
        Solution: In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000/2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000*3 = 24,000 bars. So far, Boris has produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars in the first three weeks. Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, he would produce 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_830, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time spent on TikTok activities (Changes from various times to 1128 minutes)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time Britany spends on TikTok, we only need to consider the time she spends on each activity. The change in humidity is irrelevant to the total time calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week. For the TikTok videos, she records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week on videos. For writing songs, she spends 2 hours per week, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. For makeup, she spends 15 minutes six days a week, which is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes. Adding these up, Britany spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week on TikTok. Since there are four weeks in a month, she spends 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes per month on TikTok.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of items and the cost of installation. The weight of the items is irrelevant to the total cost. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many additional items Angela has. She has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. The installation package includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. So, Angela has 2 extra mirrors (6-4), 1 extra chandelier (2-1), and 10 extra pictures (20-10). That's a total of 13 extra items. Each extra item costs $15.00, so the extra items will cost her 13 * $15.00 = $195.00. The base cost of the installation is $129.00. So, the total cost will be $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money saved, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the individuals when calculating the total amount saved.
Solution: First, we find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Next, we find out how much money Roy has saved. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, he has saved $30.00 + (40/100)*$30.00 = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the height each character can lift a mountain, the weight of the characters is irrelevant. We start with the height Pompei can lift and multiply it by the respective multipliers to find the height the other characters can lift.
Solution: First, we find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain by multiplying Pompei's height by 12. This gives us 12 inches. Next, we find out how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain by multiplying Saskay's height by 4. This gives us 48 inches. Finally, we find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain by multiplying Kagiyami's height by 10. This gives us 480 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we divide 480 by 12 to get 40 feet.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total distance traveled by Mason. The temperature is not relevant to the calculation of the total distance. We only need to consider the speed at which he is traveling and the time he spent traveling.
Solution: To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to multiply his speed by the time he spent traveling. First, he traveled for 4 hours at a speed of 8 miles per hour, which is 4*8 = 32 miles. After resting, he traveled for another 6 hours at the same speed, which is 6*8 = 48 miles. Adding these two distances together gives us the total distance traveled: 32 + 48 = 80 miles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of dishes made by each person, there is no need to consider the weight of the clay when counting the total number of dishes.
Solution: First, we find out how many clay dishes Rory made. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, and Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Next, we find out how many dishes Jada made. Since Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, and Rory made 40 dishes, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes. To find out the total number of dishes they all made, we add the number of dishes each person made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total money Erika has, the weight of Erika is irrelevant. We only need to consider the cost of the laptop, the trade-in discount, her earnings from her part-time job, the money from her mom, and the extra money she needs to buy the laptop.
Solution: First, we know that the laptop costs $600 and she gets a $200 discount for trading in her old laptop. This means the new laptop now costs $600 - $200 = $400. She also earns $150 from her part-time job and gets $80 from her mom. So, she has $150 + $80 = $230. If she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, this means she has $400 - $50 = $350. Therefore, the money in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_839, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cows (Changes from 3 to ?), Milk production per cow (Constant at 5 liters)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cows needed to produce a certain amount of milk, the weight of the cows is not relevant. We only need to consider the amount of milk each cow produces and the total amount of milk desired.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much milk the current 3 cows produce. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk, 3 cows would produce 3*5=15 liters of milk. Now, we need to find out how much more milk is needed to reach the target of 25 liters. The difference between 25 and 15 is 10 liters. Since each cow produces 5 liters, the farmer would need 10/5=2 more cows to reach the target.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy and the money he currently has. The weight of Gabriel is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy. This is done by adding the cost of the car ($10000) and the phone ($800), which gives us $10800. Next, we need to find out how much money Gabriel currently has. This is done by adding the money he has from working ($5000) and the money his brother gave him ($200), which gives us $5200. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the money he currently has from the total cost of the items. So, $10800 - $5200 gives us $5600. Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.

Solution: To find out how much change Thea got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave to the craftsman. Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to $80. The hat cost $70. So, $80 - $70 = $10. Therefore, Thea got $10 in change.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_844, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of socks and dishes (Changes based on Jack's collection and Peter's relation to it)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of socks and dishes Peter and Jack have. The weight of Peter is irrelevant to the calculation of the total number of socks and dishes.
Solution: First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks Jack has by dividing the number of dishes by 2. This gives us 30 socks. Now, we know that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, which means Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks. We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, which means Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes. Adding up all the socks and dishes, we get 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) + 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) = 180.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_845, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of students good at math only (5), number of students good at both subjects (7)
Explanation: The problem is about finding the total number of students who are good at math. The volume of the room is irrelevant to this problem. We need to add the number of students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.
Solution: To find out how many students are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only (5) and the students who are good at both math and English. The number of students good at both subjects is found by subtracting the number of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students. So, 20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 (both subjects). Therefore, 5 (math only) + 7 (both subjects) = 12 students are good at math.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_846, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time for each group to perform (10 minutes), Total time for the concert (2 hours or 120 minutes), Intermission time (10 minutes)
Explanation: The problem is about calculating the number of groups that can perform in the concert. The temperature changes are irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much time each group takes to perform and exit the stage. This is 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, which totals to 10 minutes per group. The show is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we have 110 minutes left for the performances. Dividing 110 by the 10 minutes per group, we find that 11 groups can perform in the concert.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_847, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Principal amount ($300), Interest rate (three-quarters or 0.75), Time (3 years)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest. The humidity of the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: The simple interest is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($300) by the interest rate (three-quarters or 0.75) and the time (3 years). So, the simple interest is 300 * 0.75 * 3 = $675. The total amount Brenda will have is the sum of the principal amount and the interest, which is 300 + 675 = $975.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of shirts, specifically the difference in quantity between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars. The temperature of the store is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Half of the white shirts have collars, which means half of them do not. Half of 40 is 20, so there are 20 white shirts with no collars. There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts have no buttons. Now, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons. 30 - 20 = 10. So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Explanation: The problem involves finding out how much the farmer will earn from selling the eggs. The weight of the eggs is irrelevant in this case. We need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with his eggs and then multiply that by the selling price per tray.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with his eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs each tray can hold (30). This gives us 30 trays. Then, we multiply the number of trays (30) by the selling price per tray ($2.5) to find out how much the farmer will earn. This gives us $75.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of goats, so we don't need to consider the humidity of the farms when calculating the total number of goats left.
Solution: Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y, making a total of 100 goats (55 + 45). He then sells 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is 20 goats (10 * 2). So, he sells a total of 30 goats (10 + 20). Subtracting the number of goats sold from the initial total, we get 70 goats (100 - 30).

Explanation: The problem is asking for the average cost of each pair of shoes. To find this, we first need to find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. We then divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year by the number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year. The weight of James is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, he buys 2*12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year. Next, we divide the total amount he spends on shoes in a year ($2640) by the number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year (24). $2640 / 24 = $110. Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of buying food baskets. The weight of the food is irrelevant in this case. We need to calculate the cost of buying 3 baskets each of green and red food, taking into account the discount on the red food baskets.
Solution: First, calculate the total cost of the green food baskets. Each green food basket costs $25, so three baskets will cost 3 * $25 = $75. Then, calculate the total cost of the red food baskets. Each red food basket costs $18, but there is a $2 discount on each basket. So, the cost of each red food basket after the discount is $18 - $2 = $16. Therefore, three red food baskets will cost 3 * $16 = $48. Finally, add the total cost of the green food baskets and the red food baskets to get the total cost. $75 + $48 = $123.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_853, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of rooms (90), Time to clean each room (20 minutes)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time it takes to clean a certain number of rooms. The humidity level, which changes due to the use of cleaning products, is irrelevant to the calculation of time.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many rooms make up one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half would be 90 divided by 2, which equals 45 rooms. Next, we need to calculate how long it would take to clean these rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, it would take 20 multiplied by 45, which equals 900 minutes to clean half the rooms. However, the answer is required in hours, so we need to convert the minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we divide 900 by 60, which equals 15 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_854, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of homes (Changes from 12 to 36 to 144)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of homes built, the area of the town is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to focus on the number of homes built each year.
Solution: In the first year, the town builds 12 homes. In the second year, they build three times this amount, which is 3*12 = 36 homes. So far, they have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built so far, which is 2*48 = 96 homes. Therefore, the total number of homes built over the three years is 48 (from the first two years) + 96 (from the third year) = 144 homes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_855, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Ages of brother, sister, myself, and mom (Changes according to the given conditions)
Explanation: As the problem deals with ages, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight when calculating the ages.
Solution: Let's denote the brother's age as x. Then, my age would be x-3 (since I am three years younger than my brother) and my sister's age would be x-3-2=x-5 (since I am 2 years older than her). My mom's age would be 3x-1 (since her age is one less than three times my brother's age). Adding all these ages, we get the equation x + x-3 + x-5 + 3x-1 = 87. Simplifying, we get 6x - 9 = 87. Adding 9 to both sides, we get 6x = 96. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 16. Therefore, my age is 16-3 = 13.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, so the weight of the glue sticks is irrelevant. We need to find the total number of glue sticks needed and then figure out how many packs that equates to, considering that each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed by multiplying the number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks each student needs (2), which gives us 54 glue sticks. Then, we divide this number by the number of glue sticks in each pack (8) to find out how many packs are needed. This gives us 6.75 packs. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to buy 7 packs, which will leave him with some extra glue sticks.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of infected people, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of infected people.
Solution: On the first day, 10 people are infected. On the second day, each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so 10*6 = 60 people are infected. Adding the original 10, we have 70 people infected in total by the end of the second day. On the third day, each of these 70 people infects 6 others, so 70*6 = 420 people are infected. Adding the total from the previous days, we have 490 people infected in total by the end of the third day. Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta. The temperature of the restaurant is irrelevant to the calculation of the total tips. 
Solution: First, we calculate the total tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, she received a total of 40 * $20 = $800. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, which is 10/100 * $800 = $80 less. So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720. Adding the tips received by both, we get $800 + $720 = $1520.

Solution: Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave each of her three daughters 2 oranges, which totals to 2*3=6 oranges. She also gave her son 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given out is 6+3=9. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given out from the total number of oranges bought. Therefore, 12-9=3 oranges remained.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of burritos, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the burritos when calculating the total number of leftover burritos.
Solution: To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first calculate the total number of burritos eaten by the students. Since each student was given ten burritos and there were 50 students, a total of 50*10 = 500 burritos were eaten by the students. Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten is 500 (by students) + 20 (by Mr. George) = 520. Since George ordered 600 burritos, the number of leftover burritos is 600 (ordered) - 520 (eaten) = 80.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cars in the rink. The luminosity of the light is irrelevant to the number of cars, so we can ignore it. 
Solution: First, we find out the number of green cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. Next, we find out the number of blue cars. Since there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, and there are 10 green cars, there are 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars. Now, we add up the number of red, green, and blue cars. This is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars. Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23 cars.

Explanation: The problem deals with the weight of the vegetables Daisy bought. The temperature in the store is irrelevant to the weight of the vegetables, so we can ignore it.
Solution: First, we find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds. Then, to find the weight of the carrots, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes. So, 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of jello boxes needed to make a certain number of jello cups. The weight of the jello is irrelevant in this context, as we are given the number of cups each box can make. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, we multiply 30 by 4 to get 120 jello cups. Then, we need to find out how many boxes of jello Greg needs to buy. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, we divide 120 by 10 to get 12 boxes. Finally, we need to find out how much Greg will spend on jello. Since each box costs $1.25, we multiply 12 by 1.25 to get $15.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of groceries and how it's split between Madeline and Keenan. The weight of the groceries is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays per month. Since she pays 60% of the $400, we multiply 400 by 0.60 to get $240. This means Keenan pays the remaining amount which is $400 - $240 = $160 per month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide $160 by 4 to find out how much Keenan spends per week. $160 divided by 4 equals $40.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_871, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pizza pieces (Changes from 60 to 48)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pizza pieces eaten, Tobias's weight is not relevant to the calculation. We only need to focus on the number of pizza pieces and how many he has eaten each day.
Solution: First, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day. Since the pizza had 60 pieces, 2/5 of 60 is 24. So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So far, he has eaten 24 + 10 = 34 pieces. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. The remaining pieces before the third day were 60 - 34 = 26. So, 7/13 of 26 is 14. Therefore, he ate 14 pieces on the third day. In total, he has eaten 34 (from the first two days) + 14 (from the third day) = 48 pieces.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_872, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of soda bottles (Changes from 7 to 3), Number of water bottles (Changes from 4 to 2), Cost of soda ($21.00), Cost of water ($8.00)
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of soda and water bottles. The weight of the bottles is irrelevant to the cost calculation. We first need to find the cost of a single bottle of soda and water, and then multiply it by the number of bottles David wants to buy. The total cost is the sum of the cost of soda and water.
Solution: A bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $3.00 and a bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $2.00. The cost for the soda is 3*$3.00 = $9.00 and the cost for the water is 2*$2.00 = $4.00. The total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_873, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money David has ($12.48), cost of each bolt ($0.03), number of bolts David wants to buy (16)
Explanation: The problem is about calculating the remaining money David has after buying the bolts. The weight of David or the bolts is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much David will spend on the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03, and he wants to buy 16 bolts, we multiply 0.03 by 16, which gives us $0.48. David has $12.48, so to find out how much he has left after buying the bolts, we subtract the cost of the bolts from his total amount. So, 12.48 - 0.48 equals $12.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_875, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of marbles (Changes from 52 to 80 then to 60)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of marbles, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the marbles when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we add the number of marbles Paul initially had (52) to the number of marbles his friend gave him (28), which gives us 80 marbles. Then, we calculate 1/4 of these 80 marbles, which is 20 marbles. Finally, we subtract these 20 marbles from the total of 80 marbles to find out how many marbles Paul has left. So, 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of glasses sold, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah.
Solution: To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to figure out how many glasses Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and that Julie sold 14 glasses. So, the boys together sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find that each boy sold 9 glasses. Therefore, Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount spent at the spa, the changes in humidity are irrelevant. We only need to consider the amounts spent on the hair, manicure and pedicure.
Solution: First, we find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since it's 1/4 of what she spent on her hair, we multiply $400 by 1/4 to get $100. Next, we find out how much she spent on the pedicure. Since it's 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure, we multiply $100 by 3/4 to get $75. To find out the total amount of money she spent at the spa, we add the cost of the hair ($400), manicure ($100), and pedicure ($75). $400 + $100 + $75 equals $575.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying a new rope, we only need to consider the length of the rope and the selling and buying prices per meter. The weight of the rope is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we calculate how much Sarah earns from selling her old rope. Since her friend is buying it for $2 a meter and the rope is 20 meters long, she earns 20 * 2 = $40. Next, we calculate how much the new rope costs. Since the new rope costs $1.5 a meter and she wants it to be the same length as her old rope, it costs 1.5 * 20 = $30. Finally, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she earned to find out how much she has left over. So, 40 - 30 = $10.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_881, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Melanie's current age (8 years old), Melanie's future age (24 years old)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age. Therefore, the weight is irrelevant to the solution. We need to find out Melanie's current age, which is 8 years old, and then calculate when she will be three times that age, which is 24 years old.
Solution: If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, that means she is currently 8 years old. If we want to find out when her age will be thrice her current age, we multiply her current age by 3. 8 times 3 is 24. To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24, we subtract her current age from 24. 24 minus 8 is 16. So, it will take 16 years for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_883, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of the concert (Changes from usual to final concert)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the length of the concert, we do not need to consider the brightness of the stage. We are given the total length of the final concert and the length of the encore. We need to subtract the length of the encore from the total length of the final concert to get the length of the main part of the final concert. Since this is twice as long as her usual concerts, we then divide this result by 2 to find the length of her usual concerts.
Solution: Subtract the length of the encore (15 minutes) from the total length of the final concert (65 minutes) to get 50 minutes. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, divide 50 by 2 to get 25 minutes, which is the length of Elaina's usual concerts.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of toys, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Argo when counting the remaining toys.
Solution: Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. This means he gave away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we subtract the number of toys he gave away from the number he started with. So, 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_885, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of chimichangas (Changes from 125 to 500)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chimichangas, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the shop when counting the total quantity.
Solution: The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. This totals to 250 chimichangas (125 + 125). On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on either Tuesday or Wednesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas. Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 250 (from Tuesday and Wednesday) + 250 (from Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_886, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of microphones (Changes from 50 to 40)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs on the stage. The area of the stage is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: The singer has 50 microphones. If 20% of them won't fit on the stage, that means 80% of them will. To find out how many microphones that is, we multiply 50 by 0.80, which gives us 40. Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, we divide this number by 2. So, 40 divided by 2 is 20. Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_887, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of birds (Changes from 6 to 34)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of birds, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we count the number of birds nesting in the bushes, which is 6. Then, we calculate 2/3rd of that number, which is 4 (since 2/3 * 6 = 4). Next, we count the number of birds feeding, which is 3 groups of eight birds each, making a total of 24 birds (since 3 * 8 = 24). Finally, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of birds. So, 6 (nesting) + 4 (flying) + 24 (feeding) = 34 birds in total.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_888, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies (Changes from 55 to 50), Number of jars (Stays constant at 5)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies in each jar, we do not need to consider Lani's weight when calculating the answer. We only need to know the total number of cookies and the number of jars.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cookies Lani had left after eating 5. She started with 55 cookies, so after eating 5, she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. Then, she divided these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars. So, 50 cookies ÷ 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of petals on the flowers, there is no need to consider the humidity on the balcony when calculating the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals, so the total number of petals on the orchids is 5*5 = 25. Joelle also has 4 African daisies and each daisy has 10 petals, so the total number of petals on the daisies is 4*10 = 40. To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals. So, 40 - 25 = 15. Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the percentage of flowering plants, we need to consider the total number of plants and the number of flowering plants. The change in humidity is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we find out how many of Mrs. Smith's plants are indoor plants by calculating one-fourth of 100, which is 25. We then subtract this from the total number of plants to find out how many are not indoor plants, which is 75. Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants, which is 50. The remaining plants are flowering plants, which is 25. To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100. So, 25 divided by 100 times 100 equals 25 percent.

Explanation: The problem deals with the speeds of different objects. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the speed of the objects. We know that a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob and its speed is given as 121 meters per second. Therefore, the speed of a thingamabob is 121/11 = 11 meters per second. Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, its speed is 5*11 = 55 meters per second.
Solution: 
Step 1: Find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11. 
        121/11 = 11 meters per second.
Step 2: Find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5. 
        5*11 = 55 meters per second.

Explanation: The problem deals with how much Mark makes in a week. His weight is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to consider his hourly wage, the number of hours he works in a day, and the number of days he works in a week.
Solution: First, we calculate Mark's new hourly wage. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was raised by $2, so now he makes $12 an hour. Then, we calculate how much he makes in a day by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a day. So, $12 times 8 hours is $96 a day. Finally, we calculate how much he makes in a week by multiplying his daily wage by the number of days he works in a week. So, $96 times 5 days is $480 a week.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the weights of different people, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating Harry's weight.
Solution: To find Harry's weight, we first find Carl's weight by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight of 55 kg, which gives us 71 kg. Then, we find Christian's weight by adding 8 kg to Carl's weight of 71 kg, which gives us 79 kg. Finally, we find Harry's weight by subtracting 5 kg from Christian's weight of 79 kg, which gives us 74 kg.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the profit John makes from renting out his car, the temperature inside the car is irrelevant. The profit is calculated by subtracting the car payment from the total earnings from the rentals.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total amount John earns from renting out his car. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, which is a total of 30 hours. He gets paid $25 an hour, so 30 hours times $25 equals $750. Then, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings. $750 minus $500 equals $250, which is his profit.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies each nephew gets, the weight of Susan is irrelevant. We only need to consider the total number of cookies and the number of nephews.
Solution: Susan initially had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4, leaving 96 cookies. These 96 cookies are to be divided equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide the total number of cookies (96) by the number of nephews (6). 96 divided by 6 equals 16.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_900, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pages read by Denise and Daniel (Changes from 10 and 13 to 28 and 13 respectively)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the difference in the number of pages read.
Solution: To find out how many more pages Denise read more than Daniel, we first need to find out how many pages each of them read in total. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday, which is 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Daniel did not read any pages today. So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages. The total number of pages Daniel read is 13 (yesterday) + 0 (today) = 13 pages. Therefore, Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_901, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of bowls (Changes from 8 child bowls to 4 child bowls)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of bowls of soup, so we don't need to consider the weight of the pot. The pot initially has enough soup for eight child bowls. After Calvin, his wife, and their two children each have one bowl, there are four child bowls of soup left. Since there are two children, each child can have one more bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.
Solution: The pot of soup can fill four adult bowls or eight child bowls. Calvin, his wife, and their two children each eat one bowl, which totals to two adult bowls and two child bowls. Since one adult bowl is equivalent to two child bowls, the family consumes a total of four child bowls (two from the adults and two from the children). This leaves four child bowls of soup remaining. Therefore, each child can have one more bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_902, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of notebooks ($1.50 each), number of notebooks bought (5), cost of ballpen ($0.5 each), number of ballpens bought (1)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount spent by William, which is calculated by multiplying the cost of each item by the quantity and then adding them together, there is no need to consider the weight of William when calculating the total cost.
Solution: The cost of the notebooks is $1.50 each and William bought 5, so the total cost for the notebooks is 1.50 * 5 = $7.50. The cost of the ballpen is $0.5 and William bought 1, so the total cost for the ballpen is 0.5 * 1 = $0.5. Adding these together, 7.50 + 0.5 = $8.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_904, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of movies (9), Number of times each movie was seen (3), Total amount spent ($216)
Explanation: The problem deals with the average price paid per ticket. The volume of the theatre is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out the total number of times Deepa has seen the movies and the total amount she has spent.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many times Deepa has seen the movies in total. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one three times, she has seen the movies 9*3 = 27 times in total. She has spent $216 in total to see these movies. To find the average price she paid per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of times she has seen the movies. So, $216 / 27 = $8 per ticket.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_905, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours of sleep (10 hours), hours of work (8 hours), dog walking time (1 hour)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of hours Harold has free in his day, there is no need to consider the humidity of the room when calculating the total free time.
Solution: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He walks his dog for an hour each day, so he spends 10 (sleep) + 8 (work) + 1 (dog walking) = 19 hours on these activities. There are 24 hours in a day, so Harold has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time left in his day.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_906, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of blue shoe boxes (Changes from 7 to 4), Number of red shoe boxes (Changes from 9 to 6)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of shoe boxes, the weight of the box is not relevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of shoe boxes used and left.
Solution: Tim initially has 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, leaving him with 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes. He also uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes. So, he is left with 9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes. In total, he has 4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes left.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_907, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of books (Changes from 18 to 16)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of books, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Sarah and Joseph when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we first find out how many books he had initially. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, he initially had 9 books * 2 = 18 books. But Joseph lost 2 books, so he currently has 18 books - 2 books = 16 books.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of marbles, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Dean when counting the remaining marbles.
Solution: Dean initially has 30 marbles. He gives away 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is 30/5 = 6 marbles. Then he gives 10 marbles to Donald. So, in total, Dean gives away 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. He initially had 30 marbles, so after giving away 16, he is left with 30 - 16 = 14 marbles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_909, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Duncan's age (Changes from 52 to 60), Adam's age (Changes from 26 to 38)
Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Duncan and Adam, so the temperature is not relevant. We first find out Adam's age by using the information given about Duncan's age eight years ago. We then calculate Adam's age in the future.
Solution: First, we need to find out Adam's age. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (60 - 8 = 52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, Adam's age four years ago was 52 / 2 = 26. Therefore, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30. In 8 years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_910, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Size of the farms (Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that)
Explanation: The problem deals with the size of the farms, so the temperature is irrelevant to the solution. We need to find the size of both farms and add them together.
Solution: First, we need to find out the size of Farmer Smith's farm. We know it's 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so twice that is 400 acres. Add the extra 100 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. To find the total size of both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm (200 acres) to the size of Farmer Smith's farm (500 acres). 200 acres and 500 acres make 700 acres.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Colby earns in a day. His weight is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to find out how many packages he completes per hour, how much he gets paid per package, and how many hours he works in a day.
Solution: First, we find out the number of packages Colby completes per hour by subtracting 10 from 50, which gives us 40 packages. Then, we calculate how much he earns per hour by multiplying the number of packages (40) by the amount he gets paid per package ($0.20), which gives us $8.00. Finally, we find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday by multiplying his hourly earnings ($8.00) by the number of hours (8), which gives us $64.00.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_912, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time taken to drink a bottle of water, Time taken to complete a sudoku puzzle (Changes from 45 minutes to 180 minutes)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving sudoku puzzles. The time taken to solve the puzzles and the time taken to drink a bottle of water are relevant, while the humidity in the room is irrelevant to the solution.
Solution: John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, so he drinks 1.5 (45/30) bottles of water during this time. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one, which is 180 minutes (4*45). So, he drinks 6 (180/30) bottles of water during this time. Adding these together, he drinks a total of 7.5 bottles of water. However, since we can't have half a bottle, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_913, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of bologna pieces thrown (Changes from 0 to 58), Number of red balloons (20), Number of bologna pieces thrown per red balloon (2), Number of bologna pieces thrown per yellow balloon (3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of balloons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total quantity of balloons.
Solution: Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there were 20 red balloons, he threw 2*20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, so the remaining 58-40 = 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since he throws 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, there were 18/3 = 6 yellow balloons.

Explanation: The problem deals with the distance driven by Jon and the frequency of tune-ups required for his car. The temperature of the car is irrelevant when calculating the number of tune-ups needed.
Solution: Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals to 3000 miles (100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles). Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he would need 3 tune-ups in that time (3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_915, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours worked (Changes from 5 to 10 to 8)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total hours worked, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total hours.
Solution: First, we find out how many hours Bruce works on Wednesday. Since he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, he works 5 * 2 = 10 hours on Wednesday. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours on Thursday. To find out how many hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours he works on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So, 5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of students.
Solution: First, we find the number of students playing volleyball by multiplying the number of students playing tennis (6) by 2, which gives us 12. Then, we add the number of students playing tennis (6), volleyball (12), and soccer (16 boys + 22 girls = 38) together. So, 6 + 12 + 38 equals 56.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_919, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of students (30), Number of lollipops sold per student (10), Selling price per lollipop ($0.8), Cost price per lollipop ($0)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money raised, we need to consider the number of students, the number of lollipops sold per student, and the selling price per lollipop. The weight of the lollipops is irrelevant to the calculation of the profit.
Solution: First, we calculate the total amount of money the class made by selling the lollipops. This is done by multiplying the number of students (30) by the number of lollipops each student sold on average (10), and then multiplying that result by the selling price of each lollipop ($0.8). This gives us 30 * 10 * 0.8 = $240. As the lollipops were bought for $0, there is no cost to subtract from the total sales. Therefore, the profit is $240.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_920, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of each type of pet (cats, dogs, rabbits, fish, gerbils)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of pets, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the house when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3*3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9-2 = 7 rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3*7 = 21 fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21/3 = 7 gerbils. Adding all these together, Larry has 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of slices in a loaf and the daily consumption of Abby and Josh. The weight of the loaf is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we find out how many slices Josh can eat by multiplying Abby's consumption by 2. That gives us 2*2 = 4 slices. Then we add Abby's and Josh's consumption to find out how many slices they eat together in a day. That gives us 2+4 = 6 slices. Finally, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf by the number of slices they eat together in a day to find out how many days the loaf will last. That gives us 24/6 = 4 days.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_922, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of shells collected per month (Constant at 1), Age of Martha (Changes from 5 to 10)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of shells collected, which is one per month, there is no need to consider the weight of the shells when counting the total quantity. Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until she turned 10, which is a total of 5 years.
Solution: Martha collects one shell every month. Since there are 12 months in a year, she collects 12 shells in a year. She started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until she turned 10. That's a total of 5 years. So, the total number of shells she collected is 12 shells/year * 5 years = 60 shells.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_924, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time for a trip (4 hours), Total time (8 hours), Total berries (24)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. The humidity and the fact that the sloth only eats when he is up in his tree are irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries. Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up, the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours (8 divided by 4). Therefore, to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, the sloth must pick up 12 berries per trip (24 divided by 2).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_925, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of water in the pool (10000 gallons), amount of water in the tank (half of the pool's water), rate of emptying the tank (500 gallons per day), number of days (6)
        Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of water in the tank after a certain number of days. The weight of the water is irrelevant to this calculation.
        Solution: First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank has 10000/2 = 5000 gallons of water. Then, we need to find out how much water is used each day. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, after 6 days, 500*6 = 3000 gallons of water will be used. Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of Junebugs Rita removes each day, so the humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the average number of Junebugs removed per day.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many Junebugs Rita removed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since she removed twice as many as she did on Monday, and she removed 39 on Monday, she removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs on both Tuesday and Wednesday. So, the total number of Junebugs she removed from Monday to Wednesday is 39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) = 195. Adding the number of Junebugs she removed on Thursday and Friday, we get 195 + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300. To find the average number of Junebugs she removes per day, we divide the total number by the number of days, which is 5. So, 300 / 5 = 60.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_929, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Speed and time of travel for both bus and car (Bus: 60 mph for 5 hours, Car: 30 mph for 8 hours)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance traveled by the bus and car, the temperature is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to consider the speed and time of travel for both vehicles.
Solution: First, we calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so it traveled 60*5 = 300 miles. The car traveled at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so it traveled 30*8 = 240 miles. To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_930, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of toys (Changes from 48 to 62)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of toys, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the toys when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys. Sophie has 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings. Adding these together gives us 48. Sophie has a total of 62 toys, so if we subtract the 48 other toys from this, we get 14. Therefore, there were 14 bouncy balls in the tube.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of balloons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which makes 4*2 = 8 water balloons. Maria had one water balloon for herself, so now they have 8+1 = 9 water balloons. Then Maria's mom came out and gave each of the 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons, which makes 5*3 = 15 water balloons. So in total, they have 9+15 = 24 water balloons.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tables needed to accommodate the boxes. The weight of the stuff is irrelevant in this context. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff the charity group has in total. Since 10 people donate 5 boxes each, that's 10*5=50 boxes. Adding the 10 boxes they already have, they have 50+10=60 boxes in total. Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, they need 60/2=30 tables in total. They already have 15 tables, so they need to buy 30-15=15 new tables.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: 
1. Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey: 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.
2. Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney: 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.
3. Add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.
4. Divide the total distance by 2 to find the average: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of Cameron's stay at the hotel. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation of the cost. We need to calculate the total cost for 17 hours of stay and compare it with the cost of a 24-hour stay to find out how much Cameron saves.
Solution: Cameron's stay is for 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. The remaining 5 hours would cost an additional 70 pesos each, for a total of 350 pesos. So, Cameron would pay a total of 1350 pesos. If he had chosen the 24-hour option, he would have paid 1600 pesos. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the amount he paid (1350 pesos) from the cost of the 24-hour option (1600 pesos). 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos. So, Cameron saves 250 pesos.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_937, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of goats (15), number of sheep (12), amount of hay each goat needs (5 pounds), amount of hay each sheep needs (7 pounds)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of hay needed for the livestock, so the humidity in the barn is irrelevant. We know the number of each type of animal and how much hay they each need, so we can calculate the total amount of hay needed.
Solution: First, we calculate the amount of hay each type of animal needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, so 15 goats need 15*5 = 75 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which is 2*5-3 = 7 pounds. So, 12 sheep need 12*7 = 84 pounds of hay. Adding these together, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of children in the drill, we only need to consider the number of children in a row, the number of rows, and the number of schools. The humidity in the air is irrelevant to the total number of children.
Solution: To find the total number of children in the drill, we first find out how many children are in one school by multiplying the number of children in a row (8) by the number of rows (7). This gives us 56 children per school. Since there are 5 schools, we then multiply 56 by 5 to get the total number of children, which is 280.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_941, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of coupons (9), worth of each coupon (100 bottles), number of students (29), number of bottles given to each student (2)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of apple juice bottles the teacher has left after giving some to her students. The volume of the classroom is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of apple juice bottles the teacher gets from her coupons. Since each coupon is worth 100 bottles, and she has 9 coupons, she gets 9 * 100 = 900 bottles of apple juice. Then, we calculate how many bottles she gives to her students. Since there are 29 students and each gets 2 bottles, she gives out 29 * 2 = 58 bottles. Finally, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she got from her coupons to find out how many bottles she has left for herself. So, 900 - 58 = 842 bottles of apple juice.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total charge, the temperature is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to consider the visit charge, labor charge per hour, labor hours, and parts charge to find the total charge.
Solution: To find the total charge, we first calculate the labor charge. Patty charges $35 per hour and the job took 2.25 hours. So, the labor charge is 35 * 2.25 = $78.75. Then, we add the visit charge ($40), the labor charge ($78.75), and the parts charge ($60). So, the total charge is 40 + 78.75 + 60 = $178.75.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money James spent and earned. The weight of James is irrelevant to the calculation of the total money he was out.
Solution: Initially, James bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so that's 10 * 15 = $150. However, he got a 40% discount, so he actually paid 60% of the original price. 60% of $150 is 0.6 * 150 = $90. Then, he sold 5 CDs for $40. So, he was out $90 - $40 = $50.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of loaves, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the bread when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out what seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday is. This is done by multiplying 70 (the number of loaves Sam had) by 7, which gives us 490. The bakery has 40 less than this number, so we subtract 40 from 490 to get the total number of loaves the bakery has. 490 minus 40 equals 450.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of Marcus, Deanna and Leo, the humidity in the room is irrelevant to finding Leo's age.
Solution: First, we know that Deanna is 26 years old. Since Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pages in the book, the weight of the book is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total number of pages based on the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, we need to take this into account when calculating the total number of pages.
Solution: To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the number of pages per inch (100) by the thickness of the book in inches (5). 100 pages per inch and 5 inches make 500 pages. However, since each paper is printed on both sides, we divide the total number of pages by 2. So, 500 divided by 2 is 250.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of reports stapled, which is dependent on the time spent stapling and not on Vince's weight, there is no need to consider Vince's weight when calculating the total number of reports stapled.
Solution: First, we need to find out how long Vince was stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, he can staple 120 reports in an hour (30 reports * 4). Therefore, in 15 hours, he would have stapled 1800 reports (120 reports * 15 hours).

Explanation: The problem deals with the time Kim spent sleeping on her bed. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to this calculation. We only need to consider the time she usually sleeps, the time she spent sleepwalking, and the time she woke up earlier than usual.
Solution: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. However, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. So, we subtract these 23 minutes from the total sleep time. Also, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. So, we subtract these 5 minutes as well. Hence, the total time she slept on her bed is 480 - 23 - 5 = 452 minutes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of emails Robyn sends a day. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the question asked. We need to calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend. 
Solution: Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. This leaves us with 16 - 7 = 9 emails. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to her family. This means she sends 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails to her family. This leaves us with 9 - 6 = 3 emails. One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend. This means she sends 1/3 * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend.

Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Aliya, Shawna, and Shawna's father. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the calculation of their ages.
Solution: First, we find out how old Shawna is. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is 3*3 = 9 years old. Then, to find out how old Shawna's father is, we multiply Shawna's age by 5, because Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, Shawna's father is 9*5 = 45 years old.

Solution: Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number of people by 20%. To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to subtract 20% of 48 (which is 9.6) from 48. This gives us 38.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 40.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_960, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of holes (Changes from 10 to 40)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of holes dug by the pirates, so the humidity changes are irrelevant. We need to track the changes in the number of holes over the four days.
Solution: On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes. On the second day, they dug 13 more holes, bringing the total to 23 holes. On the third day, they dug 8 more holes, but filled in 2, leaving them with 29 holes. On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day, which means it had 40 holes. Therefore, the pirates must have dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure (40 total holes - 29 holes from the first three days).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_962, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of supplies ($400), Increase in ticket cost (50% more than supplies)
Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of travel, which includes the cost of supplies and the cost of tickets. The weight of Jen is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much more the tickets cost than the supplies. Since the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we calculate 50% of $400, which is $200. Then, we add this $200 to the original cost of the supplies ($400) to find the total cost of the tickets. So, $400 + $200 = $600. This is the cost of the tickets. However, Jen also has to pay for the supplies, which cost $400. So, the total cost of the travel is the cost of the supplies plus the cost of the tickets, which is $400 + $600 = $1000.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_964, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of episodes (10), Length of each episode (20 minutes)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total time John will spend watching the show. The volume of the show is irrelevant in this case. We need to find the total number of episodes and the length of each episode to calculate the total time.
Solution: First, we find out the total number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, and each episode is 20 minutes long, there are 20/2 = 10 episodes in total. Then, to find out the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode. So, 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_966, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of brownies (Changes from 66 to 48)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of brownies, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In order to find the total number of brownies left over, we first need to find out how many brownies Greta had in total. She made a dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12. At her office, they gave her half a dozen brownies, which is 6. At her surprise party, there were 4 dozen brownies, which is 48. So, in total, she had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18. So, the number of brownies left over is 66 - 18 = 48.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_967, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Age of Nani (8 years), Age of Nani's brother (twice Nani's age), Age of Nani's sister (25% younger than Nani)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total age of the family members, we do not need to consider their weights. We first find the age of Nani's brother, which is twice Nani's age. Then, we find the age of Nani's sister, which is 25% younger than Nani. Finally, we add the ages of all three to find the total age.
Solution: First, we find the age of Nani's brother, which is twice Nani's age. So, 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Then, we find the age of Nani's sister, which is 25% younger than Nani. So, 8 - (8 * 0.25) = 6 years old. Finally, we add the ages of all three to find the total age. So, 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_968, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of racquets (12 in total: 3 synthetic gut, 5 polyester string, 4 hybrid set) and time to string each type (15 minutes for synthetic gut, 22 minutes for polyester string, 18 minutes for hybrid sets)
        Explanation: The problem is asking for the total time it will take to string all the racquets. The humidity in the shop is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to multiply the number of each type of racquet by the time it takes to string that type, and then add all those times together.
        Solution: For the synthetic gut racquets, it's 3 racquets * 15 minutes = 45 minutes. For the polyester string racquets, it's 5 racquets * 22 minutes = 110 minutes. And for the hybrid set racquets, it's 4 racquets * 18 minutes = 72 minutes. Adding all these times together, we get 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_969, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of phones (Changes from 1 to 4), Price of phones (Remains $600)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the phones John bought. The weight of the phones is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. 
Solution: John decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife. That's a total of 4 phones. The first 2 phones are full price, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200. The next 2 phones are half price, so that's 2 * ($600/2) = $600. Adding those together, $1200 + $600 = $1800. So, John paid $1800 for all the phones.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of players, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find out how many players are in Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, and Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Then, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Carlton's team (13) and Zeke's team (20). 13 and 20 make 33.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_971, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of fence (15 feet), Width of fence (10 feet), Number of wood slats per foot (2)
Explanation: Since the problem is about the number of wooden slats needed, the weight of the slats is irrelevant. We need to calculate the total length of the fence and then multiply by the number of slats needed per foot.
Solution: First, we calculate the total length of the fence by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, the total length is 2*(15+10) = 50 feet. Then, since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot, we multiply the total length by 2. So, 50*2 = 100 slats.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_974, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of books ($18, $13, $8), Saved money ($14), Hourly wage ($5)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy, the money he has saved, and his hourly wage. His weight is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much money Tyler needs in total. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. If we add these together, we get $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. This is the total amount Tyler needs. He has already saved $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, he needs to work $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours to afford his books.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_975, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cherries (Changes from 60 to 50 to 10)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cherries each person has. The weight of the individuals is irrelevant to the calculation. 
Solution: First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, this means Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. If Richard and Robert together have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, and the total number of cherries is 60, then Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries. Therefore, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela needs to pack for her vacation. Her weight is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to calculate the total sunscreen she will use over her vacation and then determine how many bottles that equates to.
Solution: Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen each day (1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day). Over 8 days, she will use 32 ounces of sunscreen (4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces). Since each bottle of sunscreen is 8 ounces, she will need 4 bottles of sunscreen (32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the cars, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cars when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we find the price of the red car by taking 40% of the price of the blue car. 40% of $100 is $40. Therefore, the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car ($100) and the price of the red car ($60). $100 + $60 = $160.

Solution: Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than what her mother gave, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads. To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. That is 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of crawfish caught, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total servings.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught in total. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is 4*3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12/2 = 6 pounds. So, in total, he caught 3+12+6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per serving to find out how many servings he has. 21/3 = 7 servings.

Solution: First, we need to find out how many students are football players. 20% of 30 students is 6 students. This leaves us with 24 students. Then, we need to find out how many of these students are cheerleaders or part of the band. 25% of 24 students is 6 students. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

Explanation: The problem deals with the size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. Charlie's boot size is five times Sophie's, so we multiply Sophie's size (5) by 5 to get Charlie's size (25). The weight of Charlie is irrelevant in this context as it does not affect the size of the boots.
Solution: First, we find out the size of Charlie's boots by multiplying Sophie's size (5) by 5, which gives us 25. Then, to find the average size, we add the size of Sophie's boots (5) and Charlie's boots (25) and divide by 2. This gives us (5+25)/2 = 15.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of filling up the flower bed, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and how many she needs to buy. The weight of the bed is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. Each plant takes up 1.5 feet of space, so we divide the length of the flower bed (111 feet) by the space each plant takes up (1.5 feet). This gives us 74 plants. Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 plants. Each plant costs $6, so to find out how much Pat will spend, we multiply the number of plants she needs to buy (57) by the cost of each plant ($6). This gives us $342.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_989, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of shrimp peeled per minute (6), time to saute shrimp (10 minutes for 30 shrimp), total shrimp to be peeled and cooked (90)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time it takes Emily to peel and cook shrimp. The temperature of the kitchen is irrelevant to solving the problem. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimps. Since she can peel 6 shrimps a minute, it will take her 90/6 = 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimps. Next, we need to find out how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimps. Since she can saute 30 shrimps in 10 minutes, it will take her 90/30 * 10 = 30 minutes to saute 90 shrimps. Therefore, it will take her a total of 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimps.

Explanation: The problem deals with the ages of Bill and his father when they saw the Comet and the Comet's orbit period. The luminosity of the Comet is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill would have seen the Comet for the first time when he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old. However, the problem states that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time. Therefore, Bill must have seen the Comet for the first time 90 - 75 = 15 years earlier.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_992, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of checks (Changes based on the frequency of writing checks)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of checks Buford writes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of checks.
Solution: To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to add up all the checks he writes. He writes 1 check for the electric bill every month, which makes 12 checks in a year. He writes 1 check for the gas bill every month, which also makes 12 checks in a year. He writes 2 checks to the church every month, which makes 24 checks in a year. And he writes 1 check to the pest and lawn service every quarter, which makes 4 checks in a year. So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 12 (for electric bill) + 12 (for gas bill) + 24 (for church) + 4 (for pest and lawn service) = 52 checks.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_993, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of flights (Changes from 44 to 88 to 22 to 11)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of flights, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity at the airport when calculating the number of flights to France.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many flights the first plane makes in total. We know that the second plane makes 44 flights, and that this is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 flights. We know that three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the remaining quarter are split between France and Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is 88 / 4 = 22. However, these flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_994, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Duration of howls (Changes for each wolf and then combined)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the duration of the wolves' howls, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity changes when calculating the total howling time.
Solution: First, we find out how long each wolf howls. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = 60 seconds. The total howling time is the sum of the howling times of all three wolves, which is 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = 120 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the total howling time in minutes is 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_995, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Money received from parents ($18), Cost of trousers ($30)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings. So, we do not need to consider Adam's weight in this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to determine how much money Adam received from his parents. His mother gave him $6 and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. So, Adam received a total of $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18 from his parents. The trousers cost $30, so to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers. That is $30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money from parents) = $12.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer's contribution is based on the total amount Walter collects from his neighbors and the online fund, and is not affected by the additional $200 Walter receives from a friend or Walter's weight. Therefore, we only need to consider the money collected from the neighbors and the online fund when calculating the lawyer's contribution.
Solution: Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals to $2000. His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as this total. So, the lawyer's contribution is 3 * $2000 = $6000. However, before the lawyer makes his donation, Walter receives an additional $200 from a friend. The lawyer's donation is based on the total amount collected before his donation, so this does not affect the lawyer's contribution. Therefore, the lawyer contributes $6000.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of cookies and the number of people. The temperature change in the room is irrelevant to the question.
Solution: First, we find out the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since each guest brought 15 cookies and there were 100 guests, we multiply 15 by 100 to get 1500 cookies. The bride then decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. To find out how many cookies were given to the church, we divide the total number of cookies by 2. This gives us 750 cookies. If each person in the church received 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received. So, 750 divided by 15 gives us 50. Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door.

Explanation: The problem involves determining the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. The weight of the watermelon is irrelevant to this calculation. Instead, we need to determine the number of 'kid-sized' slices the watermelon is divided into. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can say that each adult gets 2 'kid-sized' slices. So, the watermelon is divided into 4 (kids) + 2*2 (adults) = 8 'kid-sized' slices. Each adult gets 2 of these slices.
Solution: The watermelon is divided into 8 'kid-sized' slices. Each adult gets 2 of these slices, so each adult gets 2/8 = 25% of the watermelon.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1000, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time spent on rounds and appointments (Changes from 0 to 8 hours)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time Doctor Jones has left after his rounds and appointments, we do not need to consider the humidity in the clinic when calculating the remaining time.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds and appointments. Each round takes 20 minutes and he has 9 inpatients, so he spends 20*9 = 180 minutes on rounds. Each appointment takes 30 minutes and he has 10 appointments, so he spends 30*10 = 300 minutes on appointments. Therefore, he spends a total of 180 + 300 = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 480/60 = 8 hours. Since he is spending 9 hours at the clinic, he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to make the cake, we don't need to consider the temperature changes in the kitchen. We only need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake.
Solution: Making the batter takes 20 minutes, baking the cake takes 30 minutes, cooling the cake takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes), and frosting the cake takes 10 minutes. Adding these up, we get 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes, or 3 hours. Therefore, if the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, Jordan should start making the cake 3 hours before, which is at 2:00 pm.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of chocolate bars in a box. The weight of the chocolate bars is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find out how many boxes were sold in total and how many chocolate bars were sold in total.
Solution: Lisa sold three and a half boxes and Peter sold four and a half boxes. Adding these together gives us a total of eight boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars in total. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes. So, 64 divided by 8 equals 8. Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter and Martha have. The weight of the chocolate bars is irrelevant to the question being asked. 
Solution: First, we find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes. Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, which means each box has 64/4 = 16 chocolate bars. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, which means each box has 56/7 = 8 chocolate bars. To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes. So, 16 - 8 = 8.

Explanation: The problem is about the total number of sticks, so the humidity of the room is irrelevant. We can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.
Solution: First, we find the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks (9 + 5 = 14). Then, we find the number of yellow sticks by subtracting 3 from the number of blue sticks (14 - 3 = 11). Finally, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks (9 + 14 + 11 = 34).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance traveled by each person, the temperature is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to find out how many miles each person traveled and then compare the two distances.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many miles each person traveled. Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles. To find out how many more miles Shandy traveled than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's total from Shandy's total: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

Explanation: The problem deals with the charge of the power bank, so we don't need to consider the temperature of the room or the park. We only need to calculate the total charge lost and add it to the remaining charge to find the initial charge.
Solution: First, we calculate how much charge was lost during the 5 hours when it was losing 9% of its capacity each hour. This comes to 5 * 9 = 45%. Then, we calculate how much charge was lost during the 3 hours when it was losing 7% of its capacity each hour. This comes to 3 * 7 = 21%. The total charge lost is then 45 + 21 = 66%. Since the remaining charge was 28%, the initial charge must have been 28 + 66 = 94%.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of sweets and how they are distributed among friends. The weight of the box is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Firstly, we need to find out the total number of sweets Anne has. Since each pack contains 60 pieces and she has 15 packs, we multiply 60 by 15 to get 900. Anne kept two packs for herself, which is 2 packs times 60 pieces per pack, equaling 120 pieces. We subtract this from the total number of sweets, which is 900 - 120 = 780. Anne then distributed these 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend received 780 divided by 10, which is 78 pieces.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the price of carrots, which increases by 5% each year, there is no need to consider the temperature of the store when calculating the final price.
Solution: To find the price of the carrots after three years, we need to calculate the 5% increase each year. In the first year, the price increases by 5% of $120, which is $6, making the new price $126. In the second year, the price increases by 5% of $126, which is $6.3, making the new price $132.3. In the third year, the price increases by 5% of $132.3, which is $6.615, making the new price $138.915. However, since we usually round to the nearest dollar in pricing, the final price of the carrots after three years would be $138.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pictures in the albums, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8 to get 9 pictures per album. Then, to find out how many portraits and selfies she had, we add the number of pictures in the selfie albums (3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures) and the number of pictures in the portrait albums (2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures). Adding these together, we get 27 + 18 = 45 pictures.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1019, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of guests (Changes from 100 to 98)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of guests, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of guests.
Solution: The hotel initially had 100 guests. 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. 15 guests checked out late, leaving 76 - 15 = 61 guests. In the afternoon, twice as many people as those who opted for a late checkout checked in, that is 2 * 15 = 30 people. This increased the number of guests to 61 + 30 = 91. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, increasing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1022, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Price of small stuffed animals, price of large stuffed animals, total earnings, number of large stuffed animals sold, number of small stuffed animals sold
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of small stuffed animals sold. The weight of the stuffed animals is irrelevant to the problem. We first need to find out the price of a large stuffed animal, which is three times the price of a small one. Then we need to find out how many large stuffed animals were sold by dividing the total earnings by the price of a large stuffed animal. Finally, since twice as many small stuffed animals were sold as large ones, we multiply the number of large stuffed animals sold by 2 to get the number of small stuffed animals sold.
Solution: First, we find out that each large stuffed animal costs $4 * 3 = $12. Then, we find out that Teresa sold $120 / $12 = 10 large stuffed animals. Finally, since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 10 * 2 = 20 small stuffed animals.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1023, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sandwiches eaten per day (Man: 5, Wife: 4, Son: 2)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in a week. The weight of the man is irrelevant to the calculation of the total number of sandwiches. 
Solution: To find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in a week, we first find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in a day. This is done by adding the number of sandwiches eaten by the man (5), his wife (4), and their son (2). This gives us a total of 11 sandwiches per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten in a day by 7. 11 multiplied by 7 gives us 77.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1024, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of cookies sold, price per cookie, number of cupcakes sold, price per cupcake, money given to sisters
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Suzanne has left, we need to consider the number of cookies and cupcakes sold, their respective prices, and the money given to her sisters. The weight of the cookies and cupcakes is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes. Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, which gives us 80*1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, which gives us 60*4 = $240. Adding these two amounts, we get 80 + 240 = $320. Suzanne then gave her two sisters $10 each, which is a total of 2*10 = $20. Subtracting this amount from her total earnings, we get 320 - 20 = $300.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of eggs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the field when counting the total number of eggs found by the friends.
Solution: To find out how many eggs the friends found, we first need to calculate how many eggs the Smith twins found in total. Since each of them found 30 eggs, they found 30*2 = 60 eggs together. The team hid 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found. So, the number of eggs found is 100 - 10 = 90. Therefore, the friends found 90 - 60 = 30 eggs.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of sandwiches, which is proportional across all packages. The temperature in the store is irrelevant to the cost of the sandwiches.
Solution: The price per sandwich is constant across all packages. The first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, which means each sandwich costs $1.50. The second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6, which also means each sandwich costs $1.50. Therefore, the third package with 8 sandwiches will cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of the bedroom set and the monthly payment plan. The weight of the bedroom set is irrelevant in calculating the monthly payment.
Solution: First, subtract the amount Tom got from selling his old bedroom set from the cost of the new bedroom set. That is, $3000 - $1000 = $2000. This is the remaining amount he has to pay for the bedroom set. Then, calculate 10% of this amount per month. That is, 10/100 * $2000 = $200. So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1029, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of balloons (Changes from 44 to 34)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of balloons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Sally initially had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. This totals to 44 balloons. 40% of the red balloons burst, which is 0.40 * 25 = 10 balloons. This leaves her with 15 red balloons. She also accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, which is 0.50 * 12 = 6 balloons. This leaves her with 6 yellow balloons. So, she now has 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 6 yellow balloons, totaling to 28 balloons. She then found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection, which is 0.75 * 8 = 6 balloons. Adding these to her existing collection, she finally carried 28 + 6 = 34 balloons into the school.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of tickets each graduate would receive. The temperature of the Fine Arts Center is irrelevant in this context. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the graduates and faculty.
Solution: We start with the total number of seats in the Fine Arts Center, which is 6000. We then subtract the number of seats for graduates (950) and the number of seats for faculty (300). This gives us 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left for friends and family. If we divide this number by the number of graduates (950), we get 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets per graduate.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we don't need to consider his weight. We need to find out how many medium-sized beans he can eat, and then use that to find out how many small beans he can eat.
Solution: Since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans. Now, since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount spent, we need to calculate the total cost for the books and pencils separately and then add them up. The weight of Ted is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the books by multiplying the number of books (3) by the cost of each book (16 dollars). This gives us 48 dollars. Next, we calculate the total cost of the pencils by multiplying the number of pencils (3) by the cost of each pencil (6 dollars). This gives us 18 dollars. Finally, we add the total cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent. 48 dollars and 18 dollars make 66 dollars.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time it takes Richard to set off all the soda fountains. The width of the driveway, the distance between the soda bottles, and the time it takes to travel between bottles are relevant. The humidity is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Richard will place on his driveway. As his driveway is 24 feet wide and he is placing a bottle every 3 feet, he will place 24/3 = 8 bottles. However, as he starts at the first bottle, he only needs to travel to 7 more bottles. As it takes him 5 seconds to travel to each bottle, it will take him 7*5 = 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of packs Uncle Franky can make, so the weight of the apples is irrelevant. We need to find the total number of apples first, which is 40 apples per box times 2 boxes, giving us 80 apples. Then, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack to find out how many packs can be made.
Solution: First, we find the total number of apples by multiplying 40 by 2, which gives us 80 apples. Then, we divide 80 by 8 (the number of apples per pack) to find the number of packs. 80 divided by 8 equals 10. Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of cheese and the remaining money after the purchase. The temperature in the cheese shop is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese. The cost of the Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound and Amor buys 2 pounds, so the total cost for Parmesan is 11 * 2 = $22. The cost of the Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound and Amor buys 3 pounds, so the total cost for Mozzarella is 6 * 3 = $18. The total cost of the cheese is therefore 22 + 18 = $40. Amor starts with $50, so after buying the cheese, she will have 50 - 40 = $10 left to buy meat.

Explanation: The problem is about finding the total square feet of fabric Jim needs. The weight of Jim is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces, which are 2 feet longer and wider than the bed, and then calculate the total square footage for two such pieces.
Solution: First, we find the dimensions of the fabric pieces. The length of the fabric should be 6 feet (the length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet. Similarly, the width of the fabric should be 8 feet (the width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet. The total square footage of one fabric piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet. Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric of this size, we multiply 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet. Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of letters delivered, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 / 5 = 85. Adding 17 to that gives 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday. Then, find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 * 102 = 204. Adding 5 to that gives 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday. Finally, add the number of letters delivered on each day to find the total: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to consider the number of people wanting each type of salad and the cost per person for each salad. The total weight of the food is irrelevant in this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost for the chicken salad by multiplying the number of people who want it (10) by the cost per person ($6.50). This gives us $65. Next, we calculate the total cost for the pasta salad by multiplying the number of people who want it (6) by the cost per person ($6). This gives us $36. Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost. $65 + $36 = $101.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total population of South America, we need to consider the number of countries, the number of cities in each country, and the population in each city. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of the total population.
Solution: To find the total population, we first find the population of one city, which is 1000 people. Since there are 5 cities in each country, the total population in one country is 5 * 1000 = 5000 people. Since there are 26 countries in South America, the total population in South America is 26 * 5000 = 130000 people.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the difference in height between Xavier and Cole, Ava's weight is irrelevant and does not need to be considered. 
Solution: First, we need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches since Cole's height is given in inches. 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so Xavier's height in inches is 4 feet * 12 = 48 inches. Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches. The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1049, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of books (50), Number of English books (50/2 = 25), Number of German books (50*10/100 = 5)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of Spanish books, we need to first calculate the number of English and German books. The weight of the books is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Given that half of the books are in English, that means there are 50/2 = 25 English books. 10% of the books are in German, so there are 50*10/100 = 5 German books. Therefore, the number of Spanish books is the total number of books minus the number of English and German books, which is 50 - 25 - 5 = 20.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1050, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance to be travelled (1955 kilometers), Distance already travelled (325 kilometers for 4 days)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance to be travelled, the temperature changes are irrelevant. We need to find out how much distance Bernice has already covered and subtract it from the total distance to find out how much more she needs to travel.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice drove in 4 days. Since she drove 325 kilometers each day, we multiply 325 by 4 to get 1300 kilometers. Then, we subtract this number from the total distance between San Diego and New York City, which is 1955 kilometers. So, 1955 - 1300 equals 655 kilometers. Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water Ingrid drinks, there is no need to consider her weight when calculating the total quantity of water she drinks. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. Since she drinks 8 cups a day, we multiply 8 by 30, which gives us 240 cups. Then, we need to convert this to gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide 240 by 16. This gives us 15 gallons.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1053, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of each item (Tank top: $10, Shorts: $15, Shoes: $24, Socks: $6)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the items Alison bought. The weight of the gear is not relevant to the total cost. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate the cost of each item Alison bought. The tank top cost $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24. The athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a $2 coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6. To find the total cost, we add the cost of each item: $10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of renovating the kitchen floor. The weight of the tiles is irrelevant to the cost calculation. We need to find out how many tiles are required to cover the entire floor and then multiply that by the cost of each tile to get the total cost.
Solution: The area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Since each tile is 1 SqFt (1ft by 1ft), we will need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor. Each tile costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles (200) by the cost per tile ($12). 200 multiplied by 12 equals 2400.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1055, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Insurance cost (Changes from $120 to $192 per month)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of insurance, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of James when calculating the total yearly cost.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay for insurance due to his accident. Since it's 60% more than the normal cost, we calculate 60% of $120, which is $72. So, James pays $120 + $72 = $192 per month. To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply this monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year). So, $192 * 12 = $2304.

        Explanation: The problem deals with the number of laundry loads Greg needs to do in a year. His weight is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to consider the number of twin and king size bed sheets he washes each week and the capacity of his laundry machine.
        Solution: Greg needs to wash 4 twin bed sheets and 1 king size bed sheet every week. Since his machine can only wash 2 twin bed sheets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads for the twin bed sheets (4/2). He will also need to do 1 load for the king size bed sheet. So, in total, he does 3 loads of laundry every week (2+1). Since there are 52 weeks in a year, he will need to do 156 loads of laundry in a year (3*52).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1057, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of movies watched (Changes from 4 on Saturday to 2 on Sunday)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of movies watched, which we already have, there is no need to consider the volume of the movies when counting the total number of movies watched.
Solution: Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday. That means they watch 2 movies on Sunday (half of 4). So, in one weekend, they watch 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies. If they do this every weekend for 4 weeks, they will watch 6 (movies per weekend) * 4 (weeks) = 24 movies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of stickers collected by Leo. The weight of the collection is irrelevant to the question asked. 
Solution: Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Last year, he collected 50 more, which brings his total to 150 stickers (100 + 50). This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is 100 stickers (50 x 2). So, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is 250 stickers (150 + 100).

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of days a certain amount of cat food will last. The weight of the cat food she initially had and the weight of the cat food she has left at the end of the day are irrelevant to the solution. We only need to consider the number of cats, the amount of cat food used per day, and the total amount of cat food.
Solution: Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. This means she feeds her cats a total of 3 cats * 2 times * 60 grams = 360 grams of cat food per day. To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the amount of cat food used per day. So, 720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1060, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pizza slices (Changes from 32 to 31)
Explanation: The problem is about the number of pizza slices eaten. The weight of the pizzas is irrelevant to the solution. 
Solution: First, we find the total number of pizza slices by multiplying the number of pizzas (4) by the number of slices per pizza (8). This gives us 32 slices. We know that Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, which is 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which is 14 slices. Adding up all the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia gives us 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1061, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time taken by Betsy and Donovan (Changes from unknown to 58 minutes for Betsy and 40 minutes for Donovan)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken by Betsy and Donovan, there is no need to consider the temperature changes in the kitchen when calculating the time taken.
Solution: To find out how long Betsy's part was, we first need to find out how long Donovan's part was. Since the total time was 98 minutes and Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can set up the equation: Donovan's time + Betsy's time = Total time. Betsy's time is Donovan's time + 18 minutes. So, we substitute Betsy's time in the first equation with Donovan's time + 18 minutes: Donovan's time + (Donovan's time + 18 minutes) = 98 minutes. Solving this equation gives us Donovan's time as 40 minutes. Therefore, Betsy's time is Donovan's time + 18 minutes = 40 minutes + 18 minutes = 58 minutes.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1063, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of emails (Changes from 80 to 64 after considering the ones that don't require a response)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of emails James responds to, the humidity in the office is irrelevant. We first need to calculate the number of emails that don't require a response, which is 20% of 80. Subtracting this from the total number of emails gives us the number of emails James responds to in a day. Multiplying this by 5 gives us the number of emails he responds to in a week.
Solution: First, we find out how many emails James doesn't respond to. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80, which is 16. This means James responds to 80 - 16 = 64 emails a day. Over a 5 day work week, he would respond to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1064, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of classes (Changes from day to day)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of classes that visited the Science Center, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of classes.
Solution: To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we add the number of classes that visited each day. On Monday, 32 classes visited. On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday visited, which is 2*32 = 64. On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday visited, which is 3*32 = 96. On Thursday, 30 classes visited and on Friday, 25 classes visited. Adding all these together, 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of mailing coupons. The weight of the coupons is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost. We need to calculate the total number of big coupons, which is twice the number of small coupons. Then, we calculate the total cost for mailing the small and big coupons and add the two amounts together.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of big coupons Anthony is sending out, which is twice the number of small coupons. So, 700 small coupons * 2 = 1400 big coupons. Next, we calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons, which is 700 coupons * 5 cents = $35. Then, we calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons, which is 1400 coupons * 15 cents = $210. Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost: $35 + $210 = $245.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of meatballs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the sub sandwiches when counting the total quantity of meatballs.
Solution: Sidney initially ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs. Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, which is 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs. So, Sidney was left with 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs. Then Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, which is 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs. So, in total, Sidney had 12 + 12 = 24 meatballs.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of fertiliser delivered, we need to consider the number of trucks and the amount of fertiliser each truck carries. The temperature changes are irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we find out how many trucks were able to deliver the fertilisers. Since a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, this means that 75% of the trucks were able to deliver. 75% of 20 trucks is 15 trucks. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so 15 trucks would be carrying 15*20 = 300 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, 300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers that day.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1070, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of pounds of butter (Changes from 1 to 6), Price of butter (Constant at $4)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of buying butter, we need to consider the number of pounds of butter needed and the price of butter. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: To find out how much it will cost Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to understand the promotion. The promotion is buy one pound of butter get one half off. This means that for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay the full price for the first pound ($4.00) and half price for the second pound ($2.00). Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds. Each set costs $6.00 (4+2), so 3 sets will cost $18.00 (6*3).

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money left with Maggie and Riza. Their weights are irrelevant to the calculation. We need to find out how much money each of them spent and then subtract that from their initial amount to find out how much they have left.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much money Maggie and Riza spent. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 * 60 = $15. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 * 60 = $20. So, Maggie has 60 - 15 = $45 left, and Riza has 60 - 20 = $40 left. Adding these two amounts together, we find that they have 45 + 40 = $85 left in total.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total money made, we need to calculate the total money made from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas. The humidity in the shop is irrelevant to the total money made.
Solution: First, calculate the total money made from selling milkshakes by multiplying the number of milkshakes (6) by the price of each milkshake ($5.50). This gives $33. Next, calculate the total money made from selling burger platters by multiplying the number of platters (9) by the price of each platter ($11). This gives $99. Finally, calculate the total money made from selling sodas by multiplying the number of sodas (20) by the price of each soda ($1.50). This gives $30. Add all these amounts together to get the total money made. $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of toothpicks Melanie needs to collect, the weight of the toothpicks is irrelevant. We need to calculate the number of weeks it will take for her to collect a total of 200 toothpicks.
Solution: Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. This means she has saved a total of 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks so far. She needs 200 toothpicks to make the sculpture, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks to save enough toothpicks.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the bowling scores of Frankie and Binkie, the humidity is irrelevant to the calculation. We only need to focus on the scores.
Solution: To find Frankie's score, we first need to double Binkie's score. Binkie's score is 90, so twice Binkie's score is 180. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score, so we add 15 to 180 to get 195.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1082, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance to the store (4 miles), Walking speed (4 miles per hour)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it took for James to reach the store, we need to consider the distance he walked and his walking speed. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store and then walked back home, which means he walked the same distance as the total distance from his home to the store, which is 4 miles. Then, we need to calculate how long it took him to walk this distance. Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, it took him 1 hour to walk to the halfway point and back home. Then, he walked the same distance again to finally reach the store, which took him another hour. So, the total time it took him to reach the store is 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1083, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Cost of individual bananas ($0.80), cost of a bunch of bananas ($3.00), number of bananas in a bunch (4), number of bunches bought (10)
        Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of bananas, the weight of the bananas is irrelevant. We need to calculate the cost of bananas if bought individually and if bought in bunches, and then find the difference.
        Solution: First, calculate how much it would have cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so 10 bunches of 4 bananas each would cost 10 * 4 * $0.80 = $32.00. However, Jenny bought the bananas in bunches, so she only paid 10 * $3.00 = $30.00. The difference between these two amounts is the money she saved: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the growth rate of the crocodile, the weight of the crocodile is irrelevant. We need to find out how many inches it grows in a year and then multiply that by 13 to get the growth in 13 years.
Solution: The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so it grows 8/4 = 2 inches in a year. Therefore, in 13 years, it will grow 2 * 13 = 26 inches.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total earnings from selling bicycles. The number of each type of bike sold and their respective prices are relevant to calculate the total earnings. The humidity in the store is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike. The earnings from the Trekking bikes are 150 * $450 = $67500. The earnings from the BMX bikes are 45 * $250 = $11250. The earnings from the MTB bikes are 105 * $500 = $52500. Adding all these up, Marcel earned $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $131250 in total.

Explanation: The problem deals with the height the ball reaches on its second bounce. The weight of the ball, despite changing, does not affect the height of the bounce, so it is not relevant to the solution.
Solution: First, we need to find out the height from which the ball was dropped. Since each story is 24 feet high and the ball was dropped from the third floor, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet. On the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3rds of this height, so it bounces to 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet. On the second bounce, it again reaches 2/3rds of this new height, so it bounces to 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the height of the children, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the children when calculating their heights.
Solution: First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, which means the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, which means the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, which means the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of apples sold and the price per bag. The weight of the apples is irrelevant to the calculation of the earnings.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, and a total of 2000 apples were sold, we divide 2000 by 10 to get 200 bags. Then, to find out how much the orchard earned, we multiply the number of bags (200) by the price per bag ($5). So, 200 multiplied by 5 equals 1000.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. The temperature changes are irrelevant to the calculation of the amount of meat.
Solution: To find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to reverse the process. First, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat. This was also half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the likelihood of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we only need to consider the number of sodas and the number of shaken sodas. The temperature of the room is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: Ellen started with 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. Her brother then took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas, 2 of which were shaken. Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1096, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of people helped (Changes as per the number of days)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people Billy helps, which depends on the number of days he works, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when calculating the total number of people helped.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the number of days between March 1st and April 19th. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days. Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works for 80% of the days. 80% of 50 days is 40 days. Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day. Over 40 days, he therefore helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people carried by the buses and the cars. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many people were carried by the buses and the cars. Since each bus carried 35 people and there were 12 buses, we multiply 35 by 12 to get 420. Similarly, since each car carried 3 people and there were 20 cars, we multiply 3 by 20 to get 60. To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people carried by the buses (420) and the cars (60). 420 and 60 make 480.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the age of the individuals, there is no need to consider the weight of Jeff when determining his age.
Solution: To find Jeff's age, we first determine Martha's age. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time taken to ride the slides, which is dependent on the length of the slide and the speed of sliding, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating the time difference.
Solution: To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to find out the time it takes to slide down each slide. We do this by dividing the length of the slide by the speed of the slide. For the biggest slide, it is 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes. For the second biggest slide, it is 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes. Therefore, the biggest slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of miles ran, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the runners when calculating the total distance ran by Ahito.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many miles Micah ran. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Since Amber ran 8 miles, Micah ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles. Then, we subtract the total miles ran by Amber and Micah from the total miles ran by all three. The total miles ran by all three is 52 miles. So, Ahito ran 52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Lauren needs to save for her retirement. The humidity in her room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. So, she saves $20,000 per year (20% of $100,000). If she plans to live on 40% of her current salary during her retirement, she will need $40,000 per year (40% of $100,000). Therefore, to save enough for 20 years of retirement, she will need a total of $800,000 (20 years times $40,000 per year). At her current saving rate of $20,000 per year, it will take her 40 years to save this amount ($800,000 divided by $20,000 per year).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1109, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of women (6), Height of heels (4 inches and 2 inches)
Explanation: The problem deals with the average height of heels at the party, so we don't need to consider the light luminosity. We need to find the total height of all the heels and divide it by the number of women to find the average.
Solution: Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, which totals to 12 inches. Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, which totals to 6 inches. The total height of all the heels is 18 inches. As there are 6 women, we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average. 18 divided by 6 equals 3.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of miles Soledad needs to hike each day to complete her journey on time. The humidity during her hikes is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This means she will cover 250 miles each day (125 miles * 2). There are 30 days in June, so if she walks 250 miles each day, she will cover 7,500 miles (250 miles * 30 days). However, she wants to hike 9,300 miles. Therefore, she needs to hike an additional 1,800 miles (9,300 miles - 7,500 miles) in June. If she spreads this over 30 days, she will need to hike an additional 60 miles each day (1,800 miles / 30 days).

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1111, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number and cost of red balls (3 and $9), Number and cost of blue balls (11 and $5), Number and cost of green balls (25 and $3)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total revenue from selling all the balls, we need to consider the number and cost of each type of ball. The humidity in the store is irrelevant to the calculation of the total revenue.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost for each type of ball by multiplying the number of balls by their respective cost. For red balls, we multiply 3 by $9 to get $27. For blue balls, we multiply 11 by $5 to get $55. For green balls, we multiply 25 by $3 to get $75. Then, we add these three amounts together to get the total revenue. $27 + $55 + $75 equals $157.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1112, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of apples in kilograms (Changes from 12 to 5)
Explanation: The problem deals with the division of apples among the three people. The humidity is not relevant to the calculation of how many apples each person gets.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many kilograms of apples Peter and Paul want. Peter wants a quarter of the 12 kg, which is 12/4 = 3 kg. Paul wants a third of the 12 kg, which is 12/3 = 4 kg. So, Peter and Paul together want 3 + 4 = 7 kg of apples. Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples, and Peter and Paul want 7 kg, Jacques will have 12 - 7 = 5 kg of apples left.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Raymond has. His weight, although mentioned, is irrelevant to the calculation of his remaining money.
Solution: Raymond initially had $21. He then added $11 to his savings, which makes $32 ($21 + $11). After that, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which totals to $24 ($5 + $19). To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his total savings. So, $32 - $24 equals $8.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when calculating the total number of students.
Solution: To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase from last year's enrollment. 20% of 50 is 10 (0.20 * 50 = 10). We then add this increase to the original number of students (50 + 10 = 60). Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of blinks and time, we do not need to consider the humidity around the lighthouse when calculating the time it takes for the light to blink a certain number of times.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many times the light blinks per minute. We do this by dividing the total number of blinks (255) by the total time in minutes (5). This gives us 51 blinks per minute. Then, to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we divide the total number of blinks (459) by the number of blinks per minute (51). This gives us approximately 9 minutes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the difference in the number of male and female fishes. The volume of the pond is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Initially, Tate has 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, which totals to 7 male fishes. He then buys 2 more male guppies and 2 more male goldfishes, making the total number of male fishes 11. Initially, he has 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, which totals to 12 female fishes. He then buys 1 more female guppy and 3 more female goldfishes, making the total number of female fishes 16. To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes. So, 16 - 11 = 5.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total distance John drives in a month to visit his parents. The temperature changes in his car are irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: John drives 2 hours to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph. So, the distance to his parents' house is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since he visits twice a month and returns back each time, the total distance he drives in a month is 140 miles * 2 (for the round trip) * 2 (for the two visits) = 560 miles.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance walked by Sofie and Brian, there is no need to consider the humidity during this period when calculating the total distance walked by Brian. 
Solution: In order to find out how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in that time. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk 10 miles * 7 days = 70 miles in seven days. Since Brian will walk half as far as Sofie, he will walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles in seven days.

Explanation: The problem deals with the weight of the dogs. Therefore, the temperature of the room is irrelevant to the solution. We need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs in relation to Kory's dog and then add them all together.
Solution: First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs. One of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs 60/4 = 15 pounds. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, the second dog weighs 60/2 = 30 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds. Adding Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of stickers, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the individuals when counting the total quantity.
Solution: To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to reverse the operations. Starting from Rob, who received 7 stickers, we know that these were the remaining stickers after Kris kept 9. Therefore, Kris received 7 + 9 = 16 stickers from Luis. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth, which means he received 16 * 2 = 32 stickers from Seth. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Explanation: The problem involves calculating the total number of small bags John can make. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many M&Ms John has in total. Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and he has 3 of them, he has 3*10 = 30 ounces of M&Ms. Since each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has 30*30 = 900 M&Ms. If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900/10 = 90 small bags.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a certain distance, the humidity in the regions he starts and ends his journey is irrelevant. We only need to consider the distance he flies each day and the total distance he needs to cover.
Solution: First, we find out what half of the earth's circumference is. Half of 40,000 kilometers is 20,000 kilometers. If Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, we then divide 20,000 by 400 to find out how many days it will take. 20,000 divided by 400 equals 50.

        Explanation: As the problem deals with the speed of cars, we don't need to consider the temperature changes in the room. We first need to find the speed of the 2nd fastest car by multiplying the speed of the average car by 5. Then, we find the speed of the fastest car by multiplying the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.
        Solution: The speed of the average car is 120 mph. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which gives us 120 mph * 5 = 600 mph. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, which gives us 600 mph * 1.25 = 750 mph.

Explanation: The problem deals with the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother. The weight of Valerie is irrelevant to the problem and thus can be ignored.
Solution: First, we need to find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month. Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie's salary) + $10000 (her brother's salary) = $15000. Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000. The total amount of money they all have together is $15000 (Valerie and her brother's combined salary) + $30000 (their mother's salary) = $45000.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time Grandma spends walking, the humidity is not relevant to the solution. We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and walks twice as fast on the sidewalk. Therefore, the time she spends on the sidewalk is half the time she spends on the beach.
Solution: Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. Given that she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as on the beach, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is half the time she spends walking on the beach. If she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, she will spend 20 minutes walking on the sidewalk. Therefore, the total time she spends walking is 40 minutes on the beach plus 20 minutes on the sidewalk, which equals 60 minutes.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of blue birds, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we calculate the total number of blue birds in the first set of trees. Since there are 3 trees each with 7 blue birds, we multiply 3 by 7 to get 21. Then, we calculate the total number of blue birds in the second set of trees. Since there are 2 trees each with 4 blue birds, we multiply 2 by 4 to get 8. Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which is 3. Adding these all together, 21 (from the first set of trees) plus 8 (from the second set of trees) plus 3 (from the final tree) equals 32.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1136, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of marbles (Changes from unknown to 36, then to 26)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of marbles Bob has. The weight of the marbles is not relevant to the problem. We need to first find out how many marbles Bob initially has. Since 2 dozen marbles is equal to 24 marbles, and Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more, he must initially have 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of these marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.
Solution: First, we calculate the initial number of marbles Bob has by subtracting the 2 dozen (24) marbles he receives from the total number of marbles he will have (60). This gives us 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. Then, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1137, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Temperature of the second mug (Initially unknown, calculated to be 68 degrees)
Explanation: The problem deals with the temperature of the water in the second mug. The volume of the water is irrelevant to the calculation of the temperature. The average temperature of the water after mixing is at least 40 degrees. The total amount of water is 5 ounces. So, we can set up the equation 4*33 + 1*x = 5*40, where x is the temperature of the water in the second mug.
Solution: We set up the equation 4*33 + 1*x = 5*40 to find the temperature of the water in the second mug. Solving for x, we get x = 68. Hence, the temperature of the water in the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of jellybeans, specifically the number of blue jellybeans. The weight of the jar is irrelevant to the problem, as it does not affect the count of jellybeans.
Solution: First, we need to find out the number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones, and there are 17 green jelly beans, there are 2 * 17 = 34 red jelly beans. Then, we add the number of green and red jelly beans to find out how many jelly beans are not blue. 17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51 jelly beans are not blue. Since there are 60 jelly beans in total, the number of blue jelly beans is 60 (total) - 51 (not blue) = 9 blue jelly beans.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1143, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of trees (5), Number of lemons per tree per year (6), Number of years in a decade (10)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of lemons collected over a decade, the weight of the trees is irrelevant. We only need to consider the number of trees, the number of lemons each tree produces each year, and the number of years in a decade.
Solution: First, we find out how many lemons Tim gets in a year by multiplying the number of trees (5) by the number of lemons each tree produces (6). This gives us 30 lemons a year. Then, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade (10 years), we multiply the number of lemons he gets in a year (30) by 10. This gives us 300 lemons.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of women on the bus, so the speed of the bus is irrelevant. We need to find out how many women were on the bus before any of them alighted, and then subtract the number of women who alighted. 
Solution: The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of 'parts' in this ratio is 5+9 = 14. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so each 'part' of the ratio represents 84/14 = 6 people. Since there are 9 'parts' of women, there were originally 9*6 = 54 women on the bus. If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 54 - 20 = 34.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1145, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of sunflowers sold (Changes from 0 to 291)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sunflowers sold, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the shop when calculating the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sells per day. He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2. So, he sells $26/$2 = 13 sunflowers per day. He also earns $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers, and each bouquet costs $8. So, he sells $56/$8 = 7 bouquets per day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he sells 7*12 = 84 sunflowers from the bouquets per day. Therefore, in total, he sells 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers per day. After 3 days, he would have sold 97*3 = 291 sunflowers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1146, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money Adam has ($100), cost of each rock ($5), selling price of each rock ($7), percentage of inventory sold (60%)
        Explanation: The problem is asking about the financial loss Adam incurs from his rock stand business. His weight changes are irrelevant to this calculation. 
        Solution: First, we need to find out how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy 100/5 = 20 rocks. If he sells each rock for $7, he would make 20*7 = $140 if he sold all his rocks. However, he only sells 60% of his inventory, so he makes 60/100 * 140 = $84. Since he started with $100 and now has $84, he has lost 100 - 84 = $16.

Explanation: The problem deals with the distribution of eggs among children. The weight of the eggs is irrelevant to the number of eggs each child receives. 
Solution: Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. A dozen is equal to 12, so three dozens would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. These 36 eggs are to be divided equally among her four children. So, each child would receive 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.

Explanation: As the problem deals with average speed, which is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken, there is no need to consider the temperature changes during the journey.
Solution: To find the average speed, we first need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. The total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours. The average speed is then calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, 250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of carrots Mason eats in a week, his weight change is irrelevant to the problem. We only need to calculate the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends.
Solution: Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, he eats 4*5 = 20 carrots on weekdays. He eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, so he eats 5*2 = 10 carrots on weekends. Therefore, in a week, he eats 20+10 = 30 carrots.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total time of the cassette, which is the sum of the lengths of the two songs, there is no need to consider the volume of the music when calculating the total time.
Solution: First, we find out how long the second song is. Since it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes, it is 5 + (60/100)*5 = 8 minutes long. Then, we add the lengths of the two songs to find the total length of the cassette. 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the heights of Isabel, Ned, and Carl, and the length of Carl's cane. The weight of Carl is irrelevant to the problem and does not need to be considered when finding the length of Carl's cane.
Solution: First, we find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, Ned is 5 feet tall (7 - 2 = 5). Then we find out how tall Carl is. Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 6 feet tall (5 + 1 = 6). Finally, we find out how long Carl's cane is. Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the cane is 3 feet long (6 / 2 = 3).

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of bottles of juice needed to satisfy the daily energy needs of a certain number of people. The temperature of the facility is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how many bottles of juice are needed to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand. Since one bottle covers 20%, we divide 100 by 20 to get 5. This means 5 bottles are needed per person. To find out how many bottles are needed for 2300 people, we multiply 5 by 2300 to get 11500. Since the company already produces 4200 bottles a day, we subtract this from 11500 to find out how many more bottles need to be produced. 11500 minus 4200 gives us 7300.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of land sold and the money earned from these sales. The weight of the land is irrelevant to the total money earned.
Solution: Abraham initially has 80 square meters of land. He first sells half of it, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters for $50. Then he sells another 1/4 of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters for $30. This leaves him with 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land. He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter, which totals to 20 * 3 = $60. So, the total money he earns after selling all his land is $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $60 (from the final sale) = $140.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of eggs, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs would be 3*12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which is 2*5 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which is 10-2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which is 8/2 = 4 eggs. In total, they found 5+10+8+4 = 27 eggs. To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden. So, 36-27 = 9 eggs are still hidden.

Explanation: The problem deals with the lengths of the ropes, so we don't need to consider the weight of the ropes when calculating the length. 
Solution: Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. From the problem, we know that B = Y - 7 and R = 4B. Also, we know that R + B + Y = 37. We can substitute B and R in the last equation with their equivalents. So, we get 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37, which simplifies to 6B + 7 = 37. Solving for B, we get B = 5. Substituting B = 5 in the equation R = 4B, we get R = 20. So, the red rope was 20 centimeters long.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Ronnie has left, the weight of Ronnie and Rissa is irrelevant and does not need to be considered. 
Solution: First, we find out how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, she was given 3*5 = $15. After giving some money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, which is 4/5*15 = $12. Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their sister, Ronnie gave 15-12 = $3 to their sister. Hence, Ronnie is left with 5-3 = $2.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is 2*6 = 12 clouds. On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is 2*12 = 24 clouds. On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is 2*24 = 48 clouds. To find the total number of clouds she counted from Monday to Friday, we add the number of clouds she counted each day. 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1174, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money (Changes from $1000 to $2400), Number of bills (Changes from 50 to 240)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of bills, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Thomas when counting the total quantity of bills.
Solution: Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. This means he has 1000/20 = 50 twenty dollar bills. He loses 10 bills, so he now has 50 - 10 = 40 twenty dollar bills. He uses half of these to pay a bill, so he has 40/2 = 20 twenty dollar bills left. Thomas then triples his money, so he has 20*3 = 60 twenty dollar bills. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each twenty dollar bill can be converted into 20/5 = 4 five dollar bills, Thomas now has 60*4 = 240 five dollar bills.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1175, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of goals (Changes from 6 in the first half to 10 in the second half)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of goals, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity when counting the total number of goals.
Solution: In the first half, team A scores 4 goals and team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which is 4-2=2 goals. So, the total number of goals in the first half is 4+2=6. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4*2=8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4*8=2 goals. So, the total number of goals in the second half is 8+2=10. Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6+10=16.

Explanation: The problem deals with the length of the chalk and the daily usage of the chalk. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the problem. The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday, leaving him with 2.75 inches of chalk. If he goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, which is 1 inch, we can calculate how many days he has before he has to recycle the chalk.
Solution: The teacher has 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday. If he uses 1 inch of chalk each day, he can use the chalk for 2 more days (2.75 inches / 1 inch per day) before it becomes smaller than 2 inches and he has to recycle it.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of students not on varsity, we do not need to consider the humidity in the room. We first calculate the total number of students, then subtract the number of students on varsity to find the number of students not on varsity.
Solution: Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 24 students. One-third of the girls are on varsity, which is 12/3 = 4 girls. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which is 12/4 = 3 boys. So, a total of 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students are on varsity. Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is the total number of students minus the number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1179, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of teeth (30), Number of teeth drilled (4), Number of teeth capped (7 more than drilled)
Explanation: The problem is asking for the percentage of teeth the dentist worked on. The weight of James is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we find the total number of teeth the dentist works on by adding the number of teeth he drills (4) to the number of teeth he caps (7 more than he drills, so 7+4=11). This gives a total of 4+11=15 teeth. Then, we divide the number of teeth the dentist works on by the total number of teeth James has and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage. So, 15/30 * 100% = 50%.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the age of Wendy and Colin, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Wendy and Colin when calculating their ages.
Solution: Let's denote Colin's current age as C and Wendy's current age as W. From the problem, we have two equations: W = 5*(C+7) and C+25 = W/3. We can substitute W from the first equation into the second one to get: C+25 = 5*(C+7)/3. Solving this equation gives us C = 20. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of books Bob can buy per school. The weight of Bob is irrelevant to this calculation. We first need to calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with his $27000. Then, we divide this number by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.
Solution: First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. Since 100 books cost $500, we divide $27000 by $500 to get the total number of books. This gives us 5400 books. Then, since the books are distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3 to get the number of books per school. This gives us 1800 books per school.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of apples, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the apples when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up these two apples. So, he had 2 apples. Then, he threw one apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. So, he had 2-1+5 = 6 apples. He then threw one apple at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall. So, he had 6-1+6 = 11 apples. Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the coal order, we only need to consider the weight of the coal, the weight of one bag, and the cost of one bag. The change in humidity is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many bags of coal Ali ordered. Since each bag is 50 kg, we divide the total weight of coal ordered (850 kg) by the weight of one bag (50 kg). This gives us 17 bags. Then, we multiply the number of bags (17) by the cost of one bag ($18) to find the total cost. 17 bags times $18 per bag equals $306.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the time it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs, there is no need to consider the humidity in the air when calculating the time. We only need to consider the number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour and the number of snowballs that melt in an hour.
Solution: Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. This means that in an hour, 8 snowballs will melt (2 snowballs * 4). Therefore, in an hour, Jay will have 12 snowballs (20 snowballs - 8 snowballs). To have 60 snowballs, Jay will need 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour).

Explanation: The problem deals with the age of John and Jim. The temperature is irrelevant to the calculation of their ages. 
Solution: When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. This means that the difference in their ages is the same as the age Jim was when Digimon came out. If John is 28 now, and Digimon had its 20th anniversary, this means John was 8 when Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, this means Jim was 4 years old. Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old (20 years since Digimon came out plus the 4 years he was at that time).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the haircut and color, we need to consider the length of the hair cut and the cost per inch of haircut, as well as the cost of the color. The humidity in the salon is irrelevant to the cost.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so she cut 2 inches. The cost per inch of haircut is $30, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60. The cost of the color is $40. So, the total cost of the cut and color is $60 (for the cut) + $40 (for the color) = $100.

Solution: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher. In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once. So, the total money earned by Jason is calculated as follows: (6 * $0.50) + (1 * $3.00) + (2 * $0.75) + (1 * $1.50) = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total number of pens, we do not need to consider the weight of Alain's mom when calculating the total quantity of pens.
Solution: First, we find the total number of red pens by multiplying the number of packs (5) by the number of pens in each pack (5). This gives us 25 red pens. Then, we find the total number of black pens by multiplying the number of red pens (25) by 2, which gives us 50 black pens. Finally, we add the total number of red pens (25) and black pens (50) to find the total number of pens, which is 75.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of root beer and the number of people, we don't need to consider the temperature of the cooler when calculating the amount of root beer available for each person to drink.
Solution: Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 20 gallons. Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 13 gallons. Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 8 gallons. On the fourth day, there were 3 people at the party, including Fred. To find out how much root beer each person could drink, we divide the total amount of root beer (8 gallons) by the number of people (3). This gives us 2.66 gallons per person, but since we can't have a fraction of a gallon, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2 gallons per person.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of coffee mugs, which we can find by solving the given equation. The weight of the coffee mugs is not relevant in this case.
Solution: The problem states that 'eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40'. This can be written as an equation: 4x + 8 = 40, where x is the number of coffee mugs. To solve for x, we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get 4x = 32. Then, we divide both sides by 4 to get x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of fish with different stripe colors. The volume of the tank is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of 66 is 22, so there are 22 fish with red stripes. Next, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish to find out how many fish are left. 66 - 22 = 44. Then, we find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. 5/11 of 44 is 20. So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes. To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add these two numbers together. 22 + 20 = 42.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of eyeshadow colors, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the makeup when counting the total quantity of colors.
Solution: Amy initially had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which makes 2*4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which makes 3*6 = 18 colors. So, she initially had 8 + 18 = 26 colors. Her sister stole one palette, which had 4 colors, so she was left with 26 - 4 = 22 colors. She used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6/2 = 3 colors. So, she was left with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

Solution: First, we find the height of the house by multiplying Mattison's height (60 inches) by 7, which gives us 420 inches. Then, we find the height of the first floor by multiplying Mattison's height by 3, which gives us 180 inches. To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house. So, 420 inches - 180 inches equals 240 inches.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of shells found by different teams. The humidity level is irrelevant to the calculation of the number of shells found by each team.
Solution: First, we find out how many shells team Alphas found by calculating 40% of 700, which is 280. This leaves us with 700 - 280 = 420 shells. Then, we find out how many shells team The finders found by calculating 60% of the remaining 420 shells, which is 252. This leaves us with 420 - 252 = 168 shells for team Gogetters.

        Explanation: The problem is asking for the miles the last dog needs to walk. The weight of the dogs is not relevant to this calculation. We know the total average miles all dogs need to walk and the miles walked by the first three dogs. We can use this information to find the miles the last dog needs to walk.
        Solution: The first three dogs walk a total of 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. On average, all dogs need to walk 4 * 3 = 12 miles. To find the miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs walk from the total miles all dogs need to walk. So, 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1206, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Value of house ($250,000), Loan percentage (40%), Debt payment percentage (60%)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money John has left after paying off his debts. The weight of his house is irrelevant to the calculation. We need to find the loan amount first, which is 40% of the house value. Then, we calculate how much of that loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. The remaining amount is what he has left after paying off his debts.
Solution: 
Step 1: Calculate the loan amount. 40% of $250,000 equals $100,000.
Step 2: Calculate the amount used to pay off debts. 60% of $100,000 equals $60,000.
Step 3: Subtract the debt amount from the loan amount to find out how much money John has left. $100,000 - $60,000 equals $40,000.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1207, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Weight of tunas (Changes from individual weights to total weight), Cost per kilogram (Constant at $0.50)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total earnings from selling the tunas. To find this, we need to know the total weight of the tunas and the cost per kilogram. The temperature changes are irrelevant to the calculation of the earnings.
Solution: First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas caught by Deandre. We add the weight of the first tuna (56 kilograms), the second tuna (46 kilograms), and the third tuna (26 kilograms). This gives us a total of 128 kilograms. Then, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram ($0.50) to find out how much Deandre will earn. So, 128 kilograms times $0.50 equals $64.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1208, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Price at which she bought the magazines ($72), Selling price (11/8 of the buying price)
Explanation: The problem deals with the profit made by Trinity. The weight of the magazines is irrelevant to the calculation of profit. The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.
Solution: Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them, which means she sells them for (11/8) * $72 = $99. Then, to find her profit, we subtract the cost of the magazines from the selling price. So, $99 - $72 = $27.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of balloons, which we already have, there is no need to consider the volume of the water when counting the total quantity of balloons thrown.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many balloons they had in total. Since they filled up 10 packs of balloons and each pack contains 30 balloons, we multiply 10 by 30 to get 300. Then, we subtract the 12 balloons that were left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons. So, 300 minus 12 equals 288.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of medicine, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature when calculating the total amount of medicine.
Solution: First, we find the total amount of medicine in one dosage. Saanvi combines 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 3 * 14 = 42 mL. So, one dosage contains 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine. For 8 dosages, we multiply the amount in one dosage by 8, which is 56 * 8 = 448 mL.

Explanation: The problem deals with the capacity of the classes in both schools. The area of the classrooms is irrelevant to the calculation of the total capacity.
Solution: First, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali’s class, and Ali’s class has a capacity of 120 students, each of John's classes has a capacity of 120/8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 15*2 = 30 students. To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali’s school (120 students) and the capacity of John's school (30 students). 120 and 30 make 150.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1213, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount borrowed ($300), Monthly payment ($25), Interest rate (2%), Number of months (11)
Explanation: The problem involves calculating how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. The weight of Stephen is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much Stephen has paid in the first 11 months. As he pays $25 per month, this would be 11 * 25 = $275. The total amount borrowed was $300, so after 11 months, Stephen still owes 300 - 275 = $25. Stephen also promised to pay an additional 2% interest on the money he owed. 2% of $300 is 0.02 * 300 = $6. So, in the twelfth month, Stephen needs to pay the remaining amount he owes ($25) plus the interest ($6), which is 25 + 6 = $31.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of diapers Jordan changes per day. We don't need to consider Jordan's weight when calculating this, as it is irrelevant to the number of diapers changed.
Solution: First, we need to find out the total number of diapers changed per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and Jordan has 2 children, this means a total of 2 * 5 = 10 diapers are changed per day. Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers, so Jordan changes the other half. Half of 10 is 5, so Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total time it will take for all students to try the escape room. The volume of the room is not relevant to this calculation. We need to know the total number of students, how many can try at a time, and how long each group takes.
Solution: The problem states that there are 10 students in each grade from 4-7 who get to try the escape room. This means there are 10 students * 4 grades = 40 students in total. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students who can try at a time: 40 students / 8 students = 5 groups. If each group uses their full 45 minutes, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group uses: 5 groups * 45 minutes = 225 minutes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost that Ali has to pay John. The weight of the items is irrelevant in this case. We need to calculate the total cost of the tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the tables by multiplying the number of tables (4) by the cost of each table ($20). This gives us $80. Next, we calculate the total cost of the roof frames by multiplying the number of frames (2) by the cost of each frame ($10). This gives us $20. Finally, we add the cost of the tables and the frames to find the total cost. $80 and $20 make $100.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the length of the board, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the board when calculating the length of the longer piece.
Solution: Ian's board is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, with the longer piece being 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Therefore, the longer piece is 4x. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can write the equation: x + 4x = 40. Solving this equation, we find that x = 8. Therefore, the longer piece is 4x = 4*8 = 32 feet long.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of meatballs and the amount of seasoning needed. The temperature of the kitchen is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, and each pound of beef makes 16 meatballs. To find out how much seasoning he needs for 80 meatballs, we first need to find out how many pounds of beef he needs. Since 16 meatballs come from 1 pound of beef, we divide the total number of meatballs (80) by the number of meatballs per pound (16) to get the total pounds of beef needed, which is 5. Then, we multiply the total pounds of beef (5) by the amount of seasoning per pound (2) to get the total tablespoons of seasoning needed, which is 10.

Explanation: The problem is about the amount of fabric Luke needs to buy. The weight of the windows is irrelevant to the calculation of the fabric required. The total width of the windows is found by multiplying the width of each window by the number of windows. The amount of fabric needed is then found by multiplying this total width by 2.
Solution: First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since each window is 35 inches wide and there are 5 windows, the total width is 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches. Since Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, he needs 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches of fabric.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of a call, we only need to consider the cost per minute and the duration of the call. The humidity in the booth is irrelevant to the calculation of the cost.
Solution: For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4. After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. The call lasted for 36 minutes, so there were 36 - 16 = 20 minutes at the lower rate. So, 20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4. Therefore, the total cost of the call is $4 (for the first 16 minutes) + $4 (for the remaining 20 minutes) = $8.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of money Charlie earns from his tennis lessons. The humidity on the court is irrelevant to this calculation. 
Solution: First, we calculate the earnings from the standard rate lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 each, so 4 * 80 = $320. Next, we calculate the earnings from the lessons with veterans. Charlie gives a 25% discount for these, so his rate is 80 - (80 * 0.25) = $60. He has 2 of these lessons, so 2 * 60 = $120. Finally, we add these two amounts together to find out how much he earns in total. 320 + 120 = $440.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of apples and their price, there is no need to consider Walter's weight when calculating the total money received.
Solution: First, we find out how many apples Walter ate by multiplying the total number of apples (60) by 2/5, which gives us 24. This means Walter had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left. Then, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 36 * 0.25 = 9 apples. So, Walter had 36 - 9 = 27 apples left. Finally, Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received 27 * 3 = 81 dollars.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of novels, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Regina when calculating the total number of novels.
Solution: To find the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to understand that 9 novels is 3 quarters or 75% of the total number of novels this year. To find the total, we divide 9 by 3 to get 1 quarter (or 25%) of the total, which is 3. Then we multiply 3 by 4 to get the total number of novels, which is 12.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1236, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of grapes (Changes from unknown to 84)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of grapes, so we do not need to consider the weight of Madeline when calculating the total number of grapes. 
Solution: First, we know that Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline did to make grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and since each pie requires 12 grapes, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the number of grapes Madeline ate, the number of grapes her brother used, and the number of grapes their mother used: 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 grapes.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of teachers at school that day. The humidity is irrelevant to this calculation. We start with the total number of teachers, subtract the number of sick teachers, and add the number of substitute teachers.
Solution: Initially there were 82 teachers. 13 were sick, so we subtract 13 from 82, which gives us 69. We then add the 9 substitute teachers, resulting in a total of 78 teachers at school that day.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of making macaroni and cheese, the weight of Bud is irrelevant. We only need to consider the cost of the ingredients and the frequency of making the dish.
Solution: First, we calculate the cost of making macaroni and cheese once. The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of the cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00. So, the total cost for making macaroni and cheese once is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00. Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, he spends $10.00 * 52 weeks = $520.00 in one year.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of books and bookcases. The weight of the books is irrelevant to the solution. We need to calculate how many books each bookcase can hold and then determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all of her books.
Solution: Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so that's 2*10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so that's 2*10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so that's 20-5 = 15 books. Therefore, each bookcase can hold 20+20+15 = 55 books. Elly has 110 books, so she needs 110/55 = 2 bookcases.

Explanation: The problem deals with calculating the profit made by Rose. The weight of the eggs is irrelevant to the calculation of profit. We only need to consider the cost price, selling price, and the number of eggs.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the eggs bought by Rose. She bought 5 dozens at $2.40 per dozen, so the total cost is 5 * $2.40 = $12.00. Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs. She sells 3 eggs for $1 and she has 60 eggs (5 dozens), so the total revenue is 60 / 3 * $1 = $20.00. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, so the profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of hats, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity in the room when counting the total quantity of white hats.
Solution: First, we find out how many red hats there are by dividing the total number of hats (100) by 2, which gives us 50 red hats. Then, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are left, which gives us 50 hats. After that, we find out how many blue hats there are by multiplying the remaining number of hats (50) by 3/5, which gives us 30 blue hats. Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining number of hats to find out how many white hats there are, which gives us 20 white hats.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1243, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Price of the bag (Changes from $18.00 to $15.00), Number of sticks in a bag (Constant at 30)
        Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of each stick of jerky, we don't need to consider Archie's weight. We only need to find the discounted price of the bag and the number of sticks in each bag.
        Solution: First, we find the discounted price of the bag. Since the bag is $3.00 off, we subtract $3.00 from the original price of $18.00, which gives us $15.00. Then, to find the cost of each stick of jerky, we divide the cost of the bag by the number of sticks in the bag. So, $15.00 divided by 30 equals $0.50. Since the question asks for the answer in cents, we multiply $0.50 by 100 to get 50 cents.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of questions and the percentage of questions that need to be correct. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to solving this problem.
Solution: To find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to find out how many questions she needs to get right in total. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total number of questions is 70 (from the first test) plus 40 (from the second test), which equals 110, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right, which equals 77 questions. Since she got 60% of the 70 questions right on the first test, which equals 42 questions, she needs to get 77 (total questions she needs to get right) minus 42 (questions she got right on the first test) equals 35 questions right on the second test.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1245, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of strawberry cubes (S), Number of blueberry cubes (B), Total number of cubes (116)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of ice cubes, which we already have, there is no need to consider the temperature of the freezer when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. From the problem, we know that B = 5S - 4 and S + B = 116. We can substitute B from the first equation into the second to get S + 5S - 4 = 116. Simplifying this gives 6S = 120, so S = 20. Substituting S = 20 into the equation for B gives B = 5*20 - 4 = 96. So Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

Explanation: The problem is about the number of calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars. The humidity in the dealership is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: Jason needs to sell 15 cars. Based on his historical averages, for every 2 customers that come into the dealership, one will buy a car. Therefore, he needs 30 customers to come into the dealership to sell 15 cars (15 cars * 2). Furthermore, for every 25 telephone calls he makes, he gets one person to come into the dealership. Therefore, to get 30 people to come into the dealership, he needs to make 750 telephone calls (30 customers * 25 calls per customer).

Explanation: The problem deals with the total number of light sources, which are the flashlights and candles. The humidity in the house is irrelevant to the total count of light sources.
Solution: First, calculate the total number of flashlights. There is one flashlight for each person and two for each room, so that's 4 (people) + 2*8 (rooms) = 20 flashlights. Then, calculate the total number of candles. There are 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half, so that's 4*4 (half the rooms) + 5*4 (other half of the rooms) = 36 candles. Add the total number of flashlights and candles to get the total number of light sources: 20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1253, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Hours spent at work (6 hours), time per call (15 minutes), work days per week (5 days)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of calls Tim can handle in a week, we need to consider the time he spends at work each day, the time it takes him to handle a call, and the number of days he works in a week. The humidity in the room is irrelevant to the problem.
Solution: First, we need to convert the 6 hours Tim spends at work into minutes because the time it takes him to deal with a call is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours is 6*60 = 360 minutes. If it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, then in one day he can deal with 360/15 = 24 calls. If he works 5 days a week, then in a week he can deal with 24*5 = 120 calls.

Explanation: The problem deals with the time taken for varnish to dry on paintings. The humidity of the room is irrelevant to the calculation of the time difference. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how long it takes for the varnish to dry on one painting with the old varnish and the new varnish. The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry and the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry. So, the new varnish takes 12 - 7 = 5 minutes longer to dry on one painting. Since Louise is varnishing 6 paintings, it will take 5 * 6 = 30 minutes longer for all the paintings to dry with the new varnish.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of water needed for the plants, which we already have, there is no need to consider the humidity of the garden when calculating the total amount of water required.
Solution: To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we need to add up the water required for all her plants. She has 4 plants that need half a cup of water each, which totals to 4*0.5 = 2 cups. She has 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each, which totals to 8*1 = 8 cups. The rest of her plants are 20-4-8 = 8 plants that need a quarter cup of water each, which totals to 8*0.25 = 2 cups. Adding all these up, 2+8+2 = 12 cups of water are needed every day for her plants.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the cost of the project, we need to focus on the number of popsicle sticks needed, the number of popsicles per box, and the cost per box. Bob's weight, though mentioned, is irrelevant to the cost of the project.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicles and he needs 56, we divide 56 by 8 to get 7. This means Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicles. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply 7 (the number of boxes) by 2 (the cost per box) to get 14. Therefore, it will cost Bob $14 to build his project.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of lemons needed to make lemonade. The temperature changes are irrelevant to the solution as they do not affect the quantity of lemons needed.
Solution: To find the total number of lemons Tim will need, we first find out how many lemons are needed for 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of juice and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 4 gallons will require 4*6 = 24 lemons. For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he will need twice the amount of lemon juice, which means he will need 2*6 = 12 lemons. Adding these together, Tim will need 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of blocks in the tower. The weight of the tower is irrelevant to the calculation of the number of red blocks. 
Solution: First, we calculate the number of yellow blocks, which is twice the number of blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, there are 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks. The total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12. Since there are 32 blocks in total, the number of red blocks is 32 (total) - 12 (blue and yellow) = 20.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1269, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance travelled in each direction (West: 90 miles, East: 144 miles)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the distance from Elvis's house, we only need to consider the distance he traveled in each direction. The temperature changes are irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled in each direction. He traveled west for 5 hours at 18mph, so he covered 5*18=90 miles. Then he traveled east for 8 hours at 18mph, so he covered 8*18=144 miles. Since he was traveling back towards his house when he was going east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east to find out how far he is from his house now. So, 144-90=54 miles.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1270, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Initial cost of the boat ($9000), Depreciation over the years (30%, 30%, 20%)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the value of the boat, which is affected by depreciation over the years, there is no need to consider the weight of the boat when calculating its value.
Solution: In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30% of $9000, which is $2700. So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300. In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% of $6300, which is $1890. So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410. In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of $4410, which is $882. So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1271, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of candies (Changes from 232 to 43)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of candies, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the candies when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we find the number of orange candies by multiplying the number of red candies (54) by 2, which gives us 108 orange candies. Then, we find the number of yellow candies by dividing the number of red candies (54) by 2, which gives us 27 yellow candies. We then add the number of red, orange, and yellow candies to get a total of 189 candies. Since we know the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from this to find the number of pink candies. 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of Helen's trip, which includes the cost of her hotel stay and bus travels. The speed at which she traveled is irrelevant to the calculation of the total cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the hotel stay by multiplying the cost of one night ($80) by the number of nights (3). This gives us $240. Next, we calculate the cost of one bus trip by taking 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is $8. We then multiply this by the number of bus trips (7) to get $56. Finally, we add the total cost of the hotel stay and the total cost of the bus trips to get the total cost of the trip, which is $296.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of marbles, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of Mazie when determining the number of marbles given to Darla.
Solution: Mazie gave 52 marbles in total to Dallas and Darla. Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means Dallas originally had 25 marbles (21 + 4). Therefore, Mazie gave the remaining marbles to Darla. We find this by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas originally had from the total number of marbles Mazie gave away. So, 52 - 25 equals 27. Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total cost of the cinema visit. The weight of the popcorn is irrelevant when calculating the total cost.
Solution: First, we calculate the total cost of the cinema tickets. There are 2 adults and 1 child, so the cost is 2*$12 + $8 = $32. Then, we add the cost of the popcorns, which is 2*$3 = $6. So, the total cost is $32 + $6 = $38.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, which is used to calculate the force needed to move the car. The volume of the luggage is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find the total weight of the car with all its contents. This is done by adding the weight of the car (1200 pounds), the weight of the luggage (250 pounds), and the combined weight of the two children (75 pounds each, so 150 pounds total). This gives us a total weight of 1600 pounds. The force needed to move the car is 1% of this total weight. To find this, we multiply 1600 by 0.01 (which is the decimal equivalent of 1%). This gives us a force of 16 pounds.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1276, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Length of the fence (Long side is 20 feet, Short side is 15 feet)
Explanation: The problem is about the total length of crepe paper needed, which is equal to the total length of the fence. The humidity of the fence is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to add the lengths of all sides of the rectangular fence. The long side measures 20 feet and the short side measures 15 feet. Since a rectangle has two long sides and two short sides, the total length of the fence is 2*20 + 2*15 = 40 + 30 = 70 feet. Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of good seashells, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the seashells when counting the total quantity.
Solution: First, we need to find the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny. This is done by adding the number of seashells each of them found: 214 (Tom's seashells) + 432 (Nancy's seashells) + 86 (Benny's seashells) = 732. Then, we subtract the number of cracked seashells (67) from the total number of seashells found (732). So, 732 - 67 = 665. Therefore, they found 665 good seashells together.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the total cost of place settings, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item for 12 people. The weight of the place settings is irrelevant to the cost calculation.
Solution: For dinner plates, at $6.00 each, the total cost will be 12 * 6 = $72.00. For bowls, at $5.00 each, the total cost will be 12 * 5 = $60.00. For salad plates, at $4.00 each, the total cost will be 12 * 4 = $48.00. Adding all these totals together, 72 + 60 + 48, we get $180.00.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of feed consumed by the pigs in a week and the remaining feed after that. The weight of the feed bag is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much feed the pigs eat in a day. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, each pig eats 4*2 = 8 pounds of feed in a day. Since Dexter has 5 pigs, all the pigs eat 8*5 = 40 pounds of feed in a day. In a week, which is 7 days, the pigs eat 40*7 = 280 pounds of feed. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, after a week, he would be left with 300-280 = 20 pounds of feed.

Explanation: The problem deals with the number of hot dogs required and the cost to purchase them. The temperature of the room is irrelevant to the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs. He invited 20 people and each person will eat 2 hot dogs, so he needs 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs. A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount of money James has, which is determined by the number and type of coins he has. The humidity is irrelevant to the total amount of money.
Solution: In order to find the total amount of money James has, we need to convert the coins into cents and then add them up. A quarter is worth 25 cents, a nickel is worth 5 cents, and a dime is worth 10 cents. So, James has 25 cents from the quarter, 10 cents from the two nickels (5 cents * 2), and 70 cents from the seven dimes (10 cents * 7). Adding these up, 25 + 10 + 70, gives us 105 cents.

Explanation: The problem deals with the total square feet of the quilt, which is determined by the number and size of the shirts used. The weight of the shirts is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: First, calculate the total square feet of fabric from the small shirts. Since each small shirt is 3 square feet and Octavia uses 11 small shirts, this gives 3 * 11 = 33 square feet. Next, calculate the total square feet from the medium shirts. Each medium shirt is 4 square feet and Octavia uses 8 medium shirts, so this gives 4 * 8 = 32 square feet. Finally, calculate the total square feet from the large shirts. Each large shirt is 6 square feet and Octavia uses 6 large shirts, so this gives 6 * 6 = 36 square feet. To find the total square feet of the quilt, add up these three amounts: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of sunflower seeds, we don't need to consider the weight of the sunflowers when counting the total number of seeds.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many seeds are in a small sunflower. Since a dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower with 3 dozen seeds has 3*12 = 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find out how many seeds are in a large sunflower, we calculate 50% of 36, which is 36*0.5 = 18. Therefore, a large sunflower has 36+18 = 54 seeds. To find the total number of seeds, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower and a large sunflower. Therefore, 36+54 = 90 seeds.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money the company will receive, we need to consider the number of bars produced and the price per bar. The weight of the chocolate bars is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: First, we need to find out how many bars the company produces in two weeks. Since a week has 7 days, two weeks will have 14 days. So, the company produces 5000 bars per day * 14 days = 70000 bars in two weeks. Then, we calculate how much money the company will receive for selling these bars. Since each bar is sold for $2, the company will receive 70000 bars * $2/bar = $140000.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1296, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount spent by Ellen and Lani (Changes from $0 to $335)
Explanation: The problem deals with the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani. The humidity in the mall is irrelevant to the total amount spent, so we do not need to consider it in our calculations.
Solution: To find the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani, we add up all their purchases. Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, making a total of $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $200 on two bathrobes (since each bathrobe cost $100). So, Lani's total spending is $230. Adding Ellen's and Lani's totals, $105 and $230, we get $335.

Explanation: The problem asks for the total dollar amount in the jar. The weight of the jar is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to convert each type of coin to its dollar value and then add them together.
Solution: Quarters are worth $0.25, dimes are worth $0.10, nickels are worth $0.05, and pennies are worth $0.01. Therefore, the total dollar amount is (32*$0.25) + (95*$0.10) + (120*$0.05) + (750*$0.01) = $8 + $9.5 + $6 + $7.5 = $31

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1299, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Money spent (Changes from $40 to $13)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Janet has left, the temperature at the mall is irrelevant and does not need to be considered in the calculation.
Solution: First, we need to calculate the total amount Janet spent. She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 on her movie ticket, another $7.50 on her sister's movie ticket, and $8.50 on a bracelet. So, the total amount spent is $3.50 + $7.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $27.00. Janet started with $40.00. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she started with. So, $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00. Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left.

Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money Josh makes in two weeks. The temperature in the shop is irrelevant to this calculation. We need to consider the number of cars serviced per day, the number of days Josh works in a week, the payment he receives per car, and the number of weeks.
Solution: Josh services 3 cars a day and is open 5 days a week (7 days in a week - 2 days off). So, he services 15 cars a week (3 cars/day * 5 days/week). In two weeks, he services 30 cars (15 cars/week * 2 weeks). Since he gets paid $4 per car, he makes $120 in two weeks (30 cars * $4/car).

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies, which we already have, there is no need to consider Randy's weight when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Randy initially has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies, which totals to 18 cookies. He then eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, leaving him with 15 cookies. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 13 cookies. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 11 cookies. Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding 12 cookies, which brings the total to 23 cookies.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1302, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of toy soldiers (12), price per toy for half the collection ($5), price per toy for the other half ($7)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Matthew would earn, we only need to consider the number of toys and their respective prices. The weight of the toys is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. Half of his collection is 12/2 = 6 toys. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection, which amounts to 6 * $5 = $30. The buyer is also willing to pay $7 per toy for the other half of the collection, which amounts to 6 * $7 = $42. Adding these two amounts together, Matthew would earn $30 + $42 = $72.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of cookies, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the cookies when counting the total quantity.
Solution: In order to find the number of chocolate chip cookies made, we subtract the number of rainbow cookies (2595) and oatmeal cookies (3075) from the total number of cookies made (7995). So, 7995 - 2595 - 3075 gives us 2325.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1306, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes (Changes from 37 to 29)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of lab items, specifically beakers, that Igor lost. The temperature of the room is not relevant to this calculation.
Solution: Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, which totals to 37 items. However, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 8 test tubes, and two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 16 Petri dishes. So, the total number of items Igor should have brought to the lab bench was 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 31 items. But the total number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench was 29. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is the difference between the number of items he should have brought and the number of items he actually brought, which is 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1307, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of tables (4), legs per table (4), screws per leg (2), total screws (40)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of screws left over after James assembles the tables. The weight of James is irrelevant in this case. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how many screws are needed in total. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we multiply 4 (tables) by 4 (legs) by 2 (screws) to get 32 screws. James has 40 screws, so to find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws needed (32) from the total number of screws he has (40). 40 minus 32 equals 8.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1309, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Amount of money raised (Changes for each girl)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the total amount of money raised, the weight of the girls is irrelevant to the solution. We need to calculate the amount each girl raised and then add those amounts together.
Solution: First, we find out how much each girl raised. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, who raised $430. So, Kim raised $320 + $430 = $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300. So, Maryam raised $400 + $300 = $700. Alexandra raised $430 and Sarah raised $300. So, in total, they all raised $750 (Kim) + $700 (Maryam) + $430 (Alexandra) + $300 (Sarah) = $2280.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1310, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Distance run by Vanessa (4 miles), Time taken by Aaron (16 minutes)
Explanation: The problem deals with the time taken by Vanessa to complete her part of the race. The humidity is irrelevant to the calculation of time. Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, this means that Vanessa took four times as long as Aaron to complete her part of the race.
Solution: Since Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes, Vanessa took 16 minutes x 4 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Explanation: The problem is asking for the total length of line needed, which is based on the length of the dock and the ratio of line to dock. The weight of the docks is irrelevant to this calculation.
Solution: The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. So, for 200 feet of dock, he would need 200*3 = 600 feet of line. But he already has 6 feet of line. So, the total line he needs to buy is 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1312, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Number of reservations (6), cost per reservation ($15), number of days open per week (2)
Explanation: The problem deals with the amount of money made by the restaurant. The temperature of the restaurant is irrelevant to this calculation. The number of reservations, the cost per reservation, and the number of days the restaurant is open per week are the relevant variables.
Solution: First, we need to calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes in a night. Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost for one reservation is 2*$5 + $5 = $15. Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, they make 6*$15 = $90 in a night. If they are open 2 days a week, they make $90*2 = $180 a week.

Explanation: The problem deals with the cost of each watermelon sold. The weight of the watermelons and the packaging materials is irrelevant to the cost calculation. 
Solution: First, we need to find out how much the vendor spent on each watermelon. He bought 50 watermelons for $80, so each watermelon cost him $80/50 = $1.6. He sold them at a profit of 25%, so he added 25% of $1.6 to the cost of each watermelon. 25% of $1.6 is $0.4. So, he sold each watermelon for $1.6 + $0.4 = $2.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the ages of John and his children, there is no need to consider John's weight when calculating the ages. 
Solution: John had James when he was 19. Dora is half James's age and will be 12 in 3 years, so James is currently 21. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 - 19 = 13 years younger than James. Therefore, John's youngest son is currently 21 - 13 = 8 years old. In 3 years, he will be 8 + 3 = 11 years old.

[ERROR] AdversarialExplanation -> passage_1315, Attempt: 1, retry_flag: True, Error: Invalid json output: Relevant Variables Extracted: Time taken by Ana and Jane to peel an orange (3 minutes and 4 minutes respectively)
Explanation: The problem deals with the number of oranges that Ana and Jane can peel in an hour. The weight of the oranges before and after peeling is irrelevant in this context.
Solution: In an hour, there are 60 minutes. Therefore, Ana can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges in an hour. Similarly, Jane can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges in an hour. The difference between the number of oranges that Ana and Jane can peel in an hour is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges. So, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of chickens, we need to focus on the number of animals and their legs. The weight of the animals is irrelevant in this case.
Solution: We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have 40 legs in total. But we know they have 70 legs. The difference, 30, must be the extra 2 legs each cow has. So, there must be 15 cows (30 divided by 2). This leaves 5 animals (20 minus 15) to be chickens.
