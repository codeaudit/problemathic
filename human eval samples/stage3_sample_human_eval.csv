After packing, he had 18 boxes of games.", How many boxes did he have to use? ,"Context: Luke was selling his old games. He started out with 57 games, but sold 39 of them. He packed the rest up, putting 2 games into each box. After packing, he had 18 boxes of games.

Problem: How many boxes did he have to use?

Relevant Variables: Number of games (changes from 57 to 18)

Irrelevant Variables: None

Explanation: The new variable, Number of boxes, is unrelated to the number of games variable. The units for number of boxes are not related to the units for number of games, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (number of games) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.

Solution: To find the number of boxes Luke had to use, first, we need to find the number of games he had left after selling. He started with 57 games and sold 39 of them, so we subtract 39 from 57: 57 - 39 = 18 games left. 

Next, we need to find how many boxes Luke could fill with the remaining games. Since 2 games fit in each box, we divide the number of remaining games by 2: 18 / 2 = 9 boxes. 

Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes to pack up the remaining games. FINAL ANSWER: 9",TRUE,9,3,

In addition, Faye received a free bonus DVD with a documentary about the music industry.", How many songs did Faye buy total? ,"Context: There are 2 country albums and 3 pop albums. Each album comes with a lyric sheet and has 6 songs. Faye also received a free bonus DVD with a documentary about the music industry.
Problem: How many songs did Faye buy total?
Relevant Variables: Number of country albums, Number of pop albums, Number of songs per album
Irrelevant Variables: None
Explanation: The problem is specifically asking for the total number of songs, which can be calculated using the existing variables without considering the bonus DVD. The bonus DVD is independent of the existing variables and does not contribute to the calculation of the total number of songs.
Solution: To find the total number of songs, we calculate the number of songs in each album type and then add them together.
Number of songs in a country album = 2 country albums * 6 songs per album = 12 songs.
Number of songs in a pop album = 3 pop albums * 6 songs per album = 18 songs.
To find the total number of songs, we add the number of songs in the country albums (12) and the number of songs in the pop albums (18).
12 songs + 18 songs = 30 songs.
Therefore, Faye bought a total of 30 songs. FINAL ANSWER: 30",TRUE,30,3,

Solution: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5


Context: Vincent bought 10 books about animals, 1 book about outer space, and 3 books about trains, for a total of 14 books. Each book still costs $16.
Problem: How much did Vincent spend on the books?
Relevant Variables: Number of books (changes from 10 to 14), Cost per book (remains $16)
Explanation: The new variable Total number of books is added, which represents the sum of the books Vincent bought. It is independent of the Existing Variables in the original passage. The units for Total number of books are not related to the units for Number of books or Cost per book, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (Number of books, Cost per book) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total amount Vincent spent on the books, we need to calculate the cost of each type of book and add them together.

The number of animal books purchased is 10 and each book costs $16. So, the cost of the animal books is 10 * $16 = $160.

The number of outer space books purchased is 1 and each book costs $16. So, the cost of the outer space book is 1 * $16 = $16.

The number of train books purchased is 3 and each book costs $16. So, the cost of the train books is 3 * $16 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the animal books, outer space book, and train books together: $160 + $16 + $48 = $224.

Therefore, Vincent spent $224 on the books. FINAL ANSWER: $224",TRUE,224,5,Passage doesn’t seem to make sense when noise added

Context: Paul was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday, he filled 6 bags up, and on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags, bringing the total to 9 bags.
Problem: If each bag had 8 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?
Relevant Variables: Number of bags (changes from 6 to 9)
Irrelevant Variables: N/A
Explanation: The existing variable ""Number of bags"" covers the total number of bags that Paul had filled. There are no irrelevant variables in this case.
Solution: To find the total number of cans Paul picked up, we need to add the number of cans in the bags from Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, Paul filled 6 bags, and each bag had 8 cans. So the total number of cans from Saturday is 6 bags * 8 cans/bag = 48 cans.

On Sunday, Paul filled 3 more bags. Therefore, the total number of bags on Sunday is 6 bags + 3 bags = 9 bags. Similarly, each bag had 8 cans. So the total number of cans from Sunday is 9 bags * 8 cans/bag = 72 cans.

To find the total number of cans Paul picked up, we add the number of cans from Saturday (48 cans) and Sunday (72 cans). Therefore, the total number of cans Paul picked up is 48 cans + 72 cans = 120 cans.

Problem: How many customers total did the waiter have?
Relevant Variables: Number of tables, Number of women per table, Number of men per table
Irrelevant Variables: Volume (changes from 65 to 75)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added. It is independent of the existing variables in the original passage (number of tables, number of women per table, number of men per table). The units for volume (decibels) are not related to the units for the existing variables, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of tables, number of women per table, number of men per table) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of customers the waiter had, we need to calculate the number of customers per table and then multiply it by the number of tables. 

The problem states that there are 7 tables and 7 women and 2 men at each table. To find the number of customers per table, we add the number of women and men at each table, which gives us 7 + 2 = 9 customers per table. 

Next, we need to calculate the total number of customers by multiplying the number of customers per table by the number of tables. In this case, we have 7 tables, so the total number of customers is 9 * 7 = 63.

Problem: How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out?
Relevant Variables: Existing Variables: The existing variables in the passage are the rental rate per hour (7 dollars) and the amount paid by Tom to rent a bike (80 dollars).
Irrelevant Variables: Temperature (changes from 0 to 75), Amount paid for the rental (changes from 0 to 63)
Explanation: The new variable Temperature is added, which is independent of the existing variables in the passage. The units for temperature are not related to the units for the rental rate or the amount paid. Additionally, the new variable Amount paid for the rental is included, which represents the portion of Tom's payment that was specifically for the hours he rented the bike. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables that was not already present in the original passage.
Solution: To find the number of hours Tom paid to rent the bike, we need to subtract the fixed charge of 17 dollars from the total amount paid (80 dollars).
Total amount paid - Fixed charge = Hours of bike rental
80 - 17 = 63
Now, we know that Tom paid 63 dollars for the hourly rental of the bike. Since the rental rate is 7 dollars per hour, we can divide the total amount paid by the hourly rate to find the number of hours.
Hours of bike rental = Total amount paid / Hourly rental rate
63 / 7 = 9
Therefore, Tom paid for 9 hours of bike rental.

Problem: If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, how much money did he actually earn?
Relevant Variables: Dollars earned (remains constant at 4), Number of lawns (changes from 10 to 17)
Irrelevant Variables: Area (changes from 100 to 50)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the amount of money Edward earned, we don't need to consider the area of the lawns when calculating his earnings. The area of the lawns is unrelated to the dollars earned variable and does not provide any information about the actual earnings.
Solution: In order to find the total amount of money Edward earned, we need to calculate the number of lawns he actually mowed. Given that he forgot to mow 9 lawns out of the 17 he had, we can subtract the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns to find the number of lawns he actually mowed. 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, Edward actually mowed 8 lawns. To calculate the amount of money he earned, we multiply the number of lawns he mowed by the amount earned per lawn. 8 * 4 = 32.

Meanwhile, the volume of the background music gradually increased from 30 decibels to 50 decibels."," If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total? ","Context: Chloe was organizing her bookcase, making sure each of the shelves had exactly 6 books on it. Meanwhile, the volume of the background music gradually increased from 30 decibels to 50 decibels.
Problem: If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
Relevant Variables: Number of books per shelf (remains at 6)
Irrelevant Variables: Volume (changes from 30 to 50)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added, which represents the sound volume in decibels. It is independent of the Number of books per shelf variable in the original passage. Volume cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for volume (decibels) are not related to the units for the number of books per shelf, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of books per shelf), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of books, we first need to find how many books are on each shelf. Since each shelf has exactly 6 books, and there are 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, we can calculate the total number of books on the mystery shelves by multiplying the number of mystery shelves (5) by the number of books per shelf (6). Similarly, we can calculate the total number of books on the picture shelves by multiplying the number of picture shelves (4) by the number of books per shelf (6). 

Total number of books on mystery shelves = 5 * 6 = 30
Total number of books on picture shelves = 4 * 6 = 24

To find the total number of books, we add the total number of books on the mystery shelves and the total number of books on the picture shelves.

Total number of books = Total number of books on mystery shelves + Total number of books on picture shelves
                     = 30 + 24
                     = 54

Therefore, Chloe has a total of 54 books. FINAL ANSWER: 54",TRUE,54,1,

","Context: There are 2 pencils in the drawer with a weight of 10 grams each. Tim placed 3 pencils, each weighing 12 grams, in the drawer. Now there are 5 pencils in the drawer with a total weight of 56 grams.
Problem: What is the total number of pencils?
Relevant Variables: Number of pencils (changes from 2 to 5)
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 10 to 12)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pencils, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pencils when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5

Context: Faye was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 3 bead necklaces and 7 gem stone necklaces. In addition, she sold 5 silver necklaces and 2 gold necklaces.
Problem: If each necklace cost 7 dollars, how much money did she earn?
Relevant Variables: Number of bead necklaces (changes from 3), Number of gem stone necklaces (changes from 7)
Irrelevant Variables: Number of silver necklaces (changes from 5), Number of gold necklaces (changes from 2)
Explanation: The new variables, Number of silver necklaces and Number of gold necklaces, are added. They are independent of the existing variables, Number of bead necklaces and Number of gem stone necklaces. The units for the number of silver necklaces and number of gold necklaces do not share the same physical unit as the existing variables, fulfilling Rule 5. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of bead necklaces and number of gem stone necklaces) that did not exist in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total amount of money earned, we need to calculate the cost of each necklace (7 dollars) and multiply it by the total number of necklaces sold. First, we calculate the total number of necklaces sold by adding the number of bead necklaces (3) and the number of gemstone necklaces (7). 3 and 7 make 10. Next, we multiply the cost of each necklace (7 dollars) by the total number of necklaces sold (10). This gives us 7 multiplied by 10, which equals 70. Therefore, Faye earned a total of 70 dollars from selling her necklaces. FINAL ANSWER: 70",TRUE,70,5,
596,Megan picked 19 carrots from her garden.

","Context: Megan picked 19 carrots from her garden. She then decided to weigh them using her new digital kitchen scale.
Problem: If she threw out 4 of them and then picked 46 more the next day, how many carrots would she have total?
Relevant Variables: Number of carrots (changes from 19 to 61)
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from unknown value to X)
Explanation: The new variable Weight is added, representing the weight of the carrots. It is independent of the existing variable Number of carrots. The units for weight are not related to the units for the number of carrots, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of carrots) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: To find the total number of carrots Megan would have, we start with the number of carrots she initially picked (19). 
Next, we subtract the number of carrots she threw out (4), which leaves us with 15 carrots. 
Finally, we add the number of carrots she picked the next day (46). 
Therefore, Megan would have a total of 15 + 46 = 61 carrots.

Problem: If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
Relevant Variables: Number of puppies (changes from 17 to 72)
Irrelevant Variables: None
Explanation: The problem specifically asks about the number of puppies in the shelter and the time it takes for them to be adopted. The existing variable ""Number of puppies"" provides the initial quantity of puppies, which is relevant to finding the solution. There are no irrelevant variables in this case.
Solution: Initial number of puppies in the shelter is 17. Additional puppies brought in are 55, making the total 72. The number of puppies adopted per day is 8. Dividing the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted per day (8), we find that it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted. FINAL ANSWER: 9.",TRUE,9,4,

Problem: If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?
Relevant Variables: Number of flowers (holds 5 flowers)
Irrelevant Variables: Humidity (changes from 0% to 50%)
Explanation: The new variable Humidity is added. It is independent of the number of flowers variable in the original passage. Humidity cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for humidity are not related to the units for the number of flowers, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of flowers), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the number of vases needed to hold the flowers, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers. 

Given that the vase can hold 5 flowers, we need to determine the number of vases required to accommodate all the flowers.

To calculate the total number of flowers, we add the number of carnations (6) and roses (19). 
6 carnations + 19 roses = 25 flowers.

Now, we divide the total number of flowers (25) by the number of flowers a vase can hold (5).
25 flowers √∑ 5 flowers per vase = 5 vases required.

Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold the 6 carnations and 19 roses. FINAL ANSWER: 5",TRUE,5,1,

Problem: If each page had 9 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?
Relevant Variables: Number of pages of math homework (changes from 7 to 10)
Irrelevant Variables: None
Explanation: The new variable Time is added that is independent of the number of pages of math homework variable. The units for time are not related to the units for the number of pages of math homework, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (number of pages of math homework) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of problems Katie had to complete, we first need to find the total number of problems on the math homework and reading homework separately.
Given that each page has 9 problems, to find the total problems on the math homework, we multiply the number of pages (7) by the number of problems per page (9). This gives us 63 problems.
Similarly, to find the total problems on the reading homework, we multiply the number of pages (3) by the number of problems per page (9). This gives us 27 problems.
To find the total number of problems Katie had to complete, we add the number of problems on the math homework (63) and the number of problems on the reading homework (27). This gives us a total of 90 problems.
FINAL ANSWER: Katie had to complete a total of 90 problems.

Context:
Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook. She put 11 pics into one album with a volume capacity of 5 cubic feet and put the rest into 8 different albums with each album having a volume capacity of 2 cubic feet, making a total volume of 29 cubic feet.

Problem:
How many pictures were in each album?

Relevant Variables:
Number of pictures (changes from 51 to 5)

Irrelevant Variables:
Volume (changes from 5 to 2)

Explanation:
The new variable Volume is added, which represents the capacity of each album. It is independent of the number of pictures variable in the original passage. The units for volume are not related to the units for the number of pictures, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (number of pictures) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.

Solution:
In order to find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the number of pictures uploaded (51) by the total number of albums (8).

First, we put 11 pictures into one album.

Next, we find the remaining number of pictures by subtracting the number of pictures in the first album (11) from the total number of pictures uploaded (51).

51 - 11 = 40

Now, we divide the remaining number of pictures (40) by the total number of albums (8).

40 / 8 = 5

Therefore, each album contains 5 pictures.

Augmented Passage: A store had 40 oranges in a bin, with a volume of 0.5 cubic feet. 
New Variables: Volume (changes from 0.5 to 0.3 cubic feet)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added, representing the size of the bin. It is independent of the number of oranges variable in the original passage. Volume cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for volume (cubic feet) are not related to the units for the number of oranges, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variable (number of oranges) that was not already mentioned in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6. Question: If they threw away 25 of the old ones and put 21 new ones in the bin how many would be in the bin? Solution steps: In order to find the total number of oranges in the bin after throwing away 25 old ones and adding 21 new ones, we need to subtract the 25 old oranges from the initial count of 40. 40 - 25 equals 15. 

Then, to find the final count of oranges in the bin, we add the 15 remaining old oranges to the 21 new ones that were added. 15 + 21 equals 36.

Therefore, after throwing away 25 old oranges and adding 21 new ones, there would be 36 oranges in the bin. FINAL ANSWER: 36.

Since each 2 dollar toy costs 2 dollars, we can divide the amount left by the cost of each toy to find the number of toys he can buy. 4 divided by 2 equals 2. Therefore, Kaleb can buy 2 2-dollar toys with the money he has left. FINAL ANSWER: 2.",TRUE,2,5,
349,"Bianca had 34 songs on her mp3 player, which she listened to at a constant volume of 50 decibels."," If she deleted 14 old songs from it and then added 44 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player? ","Context: Bianca had 34 songs on her mp3 player, which she listened to at a constant volume of 50 decibels.
Problem: If she deleted 14 old songs from it and then added 44 new songs, how many songs does she have on her mp3 player?
Relevant Variables: Number of songs (remains 34)
Irrelevant Variables: Volume (remains 50 decibels)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added. It is independent of the number of songs variable in the original passage. Volume cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for volume are not related to the units for the number of songs, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (number of songs) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of songs on Bianca's mp3 player, we start with the initial number of songs she had, which is 34.
Then, she deleted 14 old songs from her mp3 player. Subtraction is the mathematical operation to represent the deletion of songs. So, we subtract 14 from the initial number of songs she had, which gives us 34 - 14 = 20 songs remaining on her mp3 player.
Next, she added 44 new songs to her mp3 player. Addition is the mathematical operation to represent the addition of songs. So, we add 44 to the number of songs she had after deleting the old songs, which gives us 20 + 44 = 64 songs in total on her mp3 player.
FINAL ANSWER: Bianca has 64 songs on her mp3 player.

Context: A pet store had 102 puppies. In one day they sold 21 of them, leaving the store with 81 puppies. The remaining puppies were put into cages, with 9 puppies in each cage.
Problem: How many cages did they use?
Relevant Variables: Number of puppies (remains at 102)
Irrelevant Variables: Number of puppies in each cage (changes from 0 to 9)
Explanation: The new variable ""Number of puppies in each cage"" is added. It is independent of the existing variable ""Number of puppies"" in the original passage. The units for the new variable are not related to the units for the existing variable, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variable (number of puppies), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the number of cages used, we need to calculate the number of puppies remaining after selling some of them. To do this, we subtract the number of puppies sold (21) from the total number of puppies at the beginning (102).

102 - 21 = 81

Next, we need to calculate the number of cages needed to house the remaining puppies. Since each cage can hold 9 puppies, we divide the number of remaining puppies (81) by the number of puppies in each cage (9).

81 √∑ 9 = 9

Therefore, the pet store used 9 cages to house the remaining puppies.

Context: While shopping, Maria bought 40 green towels and 44 white towels. However, upon inspection, she realized that 4 of the white towels were actually gray in color.
Problem: If she gave her mother 65 of them, how many towels did Maria end up with?
Relevant Variables: Number of green towels (changes from 40 to 0), Number of white towels (changes from 44 to 4)
Irrelevant Variables: Color of towels (changes from green to gray)
Explanation: The new variable Color of towels is added, which is independent of the existing variables (Number of green towels and Number of white towels). The units for color are not related to the units for the number of towels, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: First, we add the number of green towels (40) and white towels (44) to find the total number of towels Maria bought.
40 + 44 = 84

Problem: If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 14 new books, how many books would Edward have?
Relevant Variables: Number of books (changes from 43 to 38)
Irrelevant Variables: Area (550 square feet)
Explanation: The new variable ""Area"" is introduced, representing the size of Edward's library. This variable is independent of the number of books and cannot be derived from it. Additionally, the units for area (square feet) are different from the units for the number of books, satisfying Rule 4. The augmented passage does not provide any numerical information about the existing variable (number of books), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of books Edward would have, we start with the initial number of books he had (43) and subtract the number of books he sold (19).

43 - 19 = 24

After selling 19 books, Edward would have 24 books remaining.

To find the final number of books Edward would have, we add the number of books he bought (14) to the number of books he had remaining after selling (24).

24 + 14 = 38

Therefore, Edward would have 38 books in total.

Problem:
If only 38 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?

Relevant Variables:
Number of carrots picked by Carol (29)
Number of carrots picked by Carol's mother (16)

Explanation:
A new variable, Soil Density, is added. It is independent of the number of carrots picked by Carol or her mother. Soil Density cannot be derived from the existing variables in the original passage. The units for Soil Density are not related to the units for the number of carrots, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of carrots picked) that did not exist in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.

The Number of flower seeds cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for Number of flower seeds are not related to the units for Number of seeds planted, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (Number of seeds planted) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: To find the number of small gardens that Nancy had, we need to determine the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens. 

Nancy started with 52 seeds. She planted 28 of them in the big garden. 

To find the number of seeds planted in the small gardens, we need to subtract the number of seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds Nancy started with. 

52 - 28 = 24 

We know that Nancy put 4 seeds in each small garden.

Relevant Variables:
Number of red bouncy balls (fixed at 4 packs)
Number of yellow bouncy balls (fixed at 8 packs)
Number of green bouncy balls (fixed at 4 packs)

Irrelevant Variables:
Weight (changes from 0.2 pounds)

Explanation:
The new variable Weight is added, which represents the average weight of each package of bouncy balls. It is independent of the existing variables in the passage. The weight cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for weight (pounds) are not related to the units for the number of bouncy balls, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of bouncy balls) that did not exist in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.

Solution:
In order to find the total number of bouncy balls bought by Maggie, we need to calculate the number of bouncy balls in each pack and then multiply it by the number of packs for each color.

First, let's calculate the number of bouncy balls in each pack. Each pack contains 10 bouncy balls.

Next, let's calculate the total number of red bouncy balls. Maggie bought 4 packs of red bouncy balls, so we multiply the number of packs (4) by the number of bouncy balls in each pack (10). This gives us 4 * 10 = 40 red bouncy balls.

Similarly, let's calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls. Maggie bought 8 packs of yellow bouncy balls, so we multiply the number of packs (8) by the number of bouncy balls in each pack (10). This gives us 8 * 10 = 80 yellow bouncy balls.

Next, let's calculate the total number of green bouncy balls. Maggie bought 4 packs of green bouncy balls, so we multiply the number of packs (4) by the number of bouncy balls in each pack (10). This gives us 4 * 10 = 40 green bouncy balls.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of bouncy balls. We add the number of red bouncy balls (40), yellow bouncy balls (80), and green bouncy balls (40) together. This gives us 40 + 80 + 40 = 160 bouncy balls.

Problem: But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
Relevant Variables: Number of red apples, Number of green apples
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 0 to 10 kilograms)
Explanation: The new variable Weight is added, which represents the weight of the additional bananas. Weight is independent of the number of red apples and the number of green apples variables. The units for weight (kilograms) are not related to the units for the number of apples (count), fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of red apples, number of green apples) that was not already mentioned in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the number of extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of apples ordered and the number of apples the students wanted.

The cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples, making a total of 25 + 17 = 42 apples.

However, only 10 students wanted fruit.

To find the number of extra apples, we subtract the number of apples the students wanted from the total number of apples ordered: 42 - 10 = 32.

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 32 extra apples.

Relevant Variables: Number of pages (constant at 1), Number of cards per page (constant at 3)
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 0 to 2 pounds)
Explanation: The new variable Weight is added, which represents the weight of the binder. It is independent of the existing variables (number of pages and number of cards per page). Weight cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for weight are not related to the units for the number of pages or number of cards per page, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variables (number of pages and number of cards per page), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the number of pages Oliver would use to organize his baseball cards, we need to calculate the total number of cards that need to be accommodated in the binder.

Given that Oliver has 2 new cards and 10 old cards, we can calculate the total number of cards as the sum of new cards and old cards:

Total number of cards = 2 + 10 = 12

Since there can be 3 cards on each page, we can find the number of pages by dividing the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:

Number of pages = Total number of cards / Number of cards per page

Number of pages = 12 / 3 = 4

Therefore, Oliver would use 4 pages to organize his baseball cards. FINAL ANSWER: 4",TRUE,4,1,

The units for temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) are not related to the units for the number of flowers picked or the number of flowers in each bouquet, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables (number of flowers picked and number of flowers in each bouquet), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: To find the number of bouquets Wendy could still make, we first need to deduct the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked.

Total number of flowers picked = 45
Number of wilted flowers = 35

Flowers available for making bouquets = Total number of flowers picked - Number of wilted flowers
                                      = 45 - 35
                                      = 10

Since each bouquet requires 5 flowers, we can find the number of bouquets by dividing the number of available flowers by 5.

Number of bouquets Wendy could still make = Flowers available for making bouquets / Number of flowers in each bouquet
                                          = 10 / 5
                                          = 2

FINAL ANSWER: Wendy could still make 2 bouquets.",TRUE,2,1,

She ate 25 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 40 more pieces. She also noticed that the volume of candy in her bag increased from 50 cubic inches to 75 cubic inches.
Problem: How many pieces of candy does Faye have now?
Relevant Variables: Number of candy pieces (changes from 47 to 62)
Irrelevant Variables: Volume (changes from 50 to 75)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added, which represents the amount of space occupied by the candy in Faye's bag. It is independent of the number of candy pieces variable. The units for volume (cubic inches) are not related to the units for the number of candy pieces, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of candy pieces) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of pieces of candy that Faye has now, we start with the initial number of 47 pieces. She ate 25 pieces on the first night, leaving her with 22 pieces. Her sister then gave her an additional 40 pieces, which we can add to the remaining 22 pieces. 22 and 40 make a total of 62 pieces. Therefore, the final answer is 62. FINAL ANSWER: 62",TRUE,62,1,

","Context: Roger is at the library helping put away books. There are 14 books to put away in total, but a librarian takes 2 of them and leaves Roger with 12 books.
Problem: If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
Relevant Variables: Total number of books (stays at 14), Number of books left after the librarian takes some (changes from 14 to 12)
Explanation: The new variable ""Number of books left after the librarian takes some"" is added. It is independent of the Total number of books variable. The units for this new variable are not related to the units for the Total number of books, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (Total number of books) at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: To find the number of shelves needed, we first subtract the number of books taken by the librarian (2) from the total number of books (14).

14 - 2 = 12

Next, we divide the remaining number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf (3).

12 √∑ 3 = 4

Therefore, Roger will need 4 shelves to accommodate all the remaining books.

Problem: If each van can hold 4 people and there are 2 students and 6 adults going, how many vans will they need?
Relevant Variables: Number of students (remains constant at 30)
Irrelevant Variables: None
Explanation: As the problem asks about the number of vans needed based on the number of people, the variable for the number of students is relevant. There are no irrelevant variables in this scenario.
Solution: In order to find the number of vans needed for the field trip, we need to determine the total number of people going. We know that there are 2 students and 6 adults going. To find the total number of people, we add the number of students (2) and adults (6), which gives us 8. Since each van can hold 4 people, we divide the total number of people (8) by the capacity of each van (4). When we divide 8 by 4, we get 2. Therefore, Debby's class will need 2 vans for the field trip. FINAL ANSWER: 2 vans",TRUE,2,5,

Problem: If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?
Relevant Variables: Number of books (changes from 46 to 36)
Irrelevant Variables: Temperature (changes from 0 to 72)
Explanation: The new variable Temperature is added, which is independent of the number of books variable. The units for temperature are not related to the units for the number of books, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of books), fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the number of shelves Oliver will need, we first need to find the number of books he is left with after the librarian takes 10 books out of the total 46 books.

Total number of books - Books taken by the librarian = Books left with Oliver
46 - 10 = 36

Therefore, Oliver is left with 36 books.

To find the number of shelves he will need, we divide the number of books by the number of books that can fit on each shelf.

Books left with Oliver / Books per shelf = Number of shelves needed
36 / 4 = 9

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves in order to store all the books.",TRUE,9,1,

Relevant Variables: Number of pencils (changes from 2 to 5)
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 10 to 12)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pencils, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pencils when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5

Input: Existing Variables: Cost per chocolate bar (remains at $4)

Augmented Passage: Each chocolate bar in a box, which cost $4, weighs 100 grams.

New Variable: Weight (changes from an unknown value to 100 grams)

Explanation: The new variable Weight is added, which is independent of the cost per chocolate bar. The units for weight (grams) are not related to the units for cost (dollars), fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (cost per chocolate bar), fulfilling Rule 6. Question: If a box had 8 bars total and Emily sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made? Solution steps: In order to find out how much money Emily would have made, we need to calculate the total cost of the chocolate bars that she sold.

Given that each chocolate bar costs $4 and there were 8 bars in total, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost per bar ($4) by the number of bars (8):

Cost per bar = $4
Number of bars = 8

Total cost = Cost per bar * Number of bars
           = $4 * 8
           = $32

Since Emily sold all but 3 bars, we need to subtract the cost of the remaining 3 bars from the total cost:

Remaining bars = 3

Money made = Total cost - Cost of remaining bars
           = $32 - ($4 * 3)
           = $32 - $12
           = $20

Therefore, Emily would have made $20 from selling the chocolate bars. FINAL ANSWER: $20

Output:
Context: Each chocolate bar in a box, which costs $4, weighs 100 grams.
Problem: If a box had 8 bars total and Emily sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?

Additionally, they brought along 2 drones for capturing aerial footage of their activities.
Problem: How many people went on the field trip?
Relevant Variables: number of vans (6), number of buses (8)
Irrelevant Variables: Drones (changes from 0 to 2)
Explanation: The new variable Drones is added, which represents the number of drones brought on the field trip. The variable is independent of the existing variables (number of vans and number of buses). Drones cannot be derived from the existing variables and the units for drones (count) are not related to the units for vans and buses (number). The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variables.
Solution: In order to find the total number of people on the field trip, we need to calculate the number of people in the vans and the number of people in the buses separately, and then add them together.
Number of people in the vans = 6 vans * 6 people per van = 36 people
Number of people in the buses = 8 buses * 18 people per bus = 144 people
To find the total number of people, we add the number of people in the vans (36) and the number of people in the buses (144):

Context: Henry had 3 action figures, but needed 8 total for a complete collection. Luckily, he came across a special offer where for each action figure purchased, he received one free comic book.
Problem: If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection?
Relevant Variables: Number of action figures (changes from 3 to 8)
Irrelevant Variables: There are no irrelevant variables in this example.
Explanation: The new variable ""Number of comic books"" is added. It is independent of the ""Number of action figures"" variable in the original passage. The units for the ""Number of comic books"" are not related to the units for ""Number of action figures"", fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any information about existing variables (""Number of action figures"") at all, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the amount of money Henry would need to finish his collection, we first need to determine how many more action figures he needs. 

He currently has 3 action figures and needs a total of 8 for a complete collection. 

To find the number of additional action figures he needs, we subtract the number he currently has from the total number needed:
8 - 3 = 5

Therefore, Henry needs 5 more action figures to complete his collection. 

Since each action figure costs $6, we can find the total amount of money he would need by multiplying the cost of one action figure by the number of additional action figures needed:
$6 * 5 = $30

Input: 'Existing Variables: Number of pieces of candy (changes from 23 to 47)', 'Augmented Passage: For Halloween Robin scored 23 pieces of candy. She ate 7 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 21 more pieces, making a total of 47 pieces of candy.', 'New Variables: Total number of pieces of candy (changes from 23 to 47)']. Explanation: The new variable ""Total number of pieces of candy"" is added, which represents the sum of the initially scored candy and the additional candy given by her sister. It is independent of the existing variable ""Number of pieces of candy"" and has different units, fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variable, fulfilling Rule 6. Question: How many pieces of candy does Robin have now? Solution steps: In order to find the total number of pieces of candy Robin has now, we need to add the number of pieces she initially scored (23) with the number of pieces she ate the first night (7) and the number of additional pieces her sister gave her (21).

So, 23 + 7 + 21 = 51
FINAL ANSWER: 51

Output:
Context: For Halloween Robin scored 23 pieces of candy. She ate 7 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 21 more pieces, making a total of 47 pieces of candy.
Problem: How many pieces of candy does Robin have now?
Relevant Variables: Number of pieces of candy (changes from 23 to 47)
Irrelevant Variables: Not present
Explanation: The existing variable ""Number of pieces of candy"" has changed to ""Total number of pieces of candy"" in the augmented passage. The new variable represents the sum of the initially scored candy and the additional candy given by her sister. As the question asks for the current total, it is necessary to consider all the candy Robin scored, ate, and received from her sister.
Solution: In order to find the total number of pieces of candy Robin has now, we need to add the number of pieces she initially scored (23) with the number of pieces she ate the first night (7) and the number of additional pieces her sister gave her (21).

588,"For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. In addition, she had 5 history questions to answer.", If she can finish 3 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems? ,"Context: For homework Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. In addition, she had 5 history questions to answer.
Problem: If she can finish 3 problems in an hour, how long will it take her to finish all the problems?
Relevant Variables: Number of math problems (changes from 13 to 15), Number of spelling problems (changes from 2 to 2)
Irrelevant Variables: Number of history questions (changes from 0 to 5)
Explanation: The new variable Number of history questions is added that is independent of the existing variables. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variables (number of math problems and number of spelling problems) at all. The units for the number of history questions are not related to the units for the existing variables, fulfilling Rule 4.
Solution: In order to find the time it will take Faye to finish all the problems, we need to calculate the total number of problems she has. The problem states that Faye has 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. To find the total number of problems, we add the number of math problems (13) and spelling problems (2). 13 + 2 = 15. So, Faye has a total of 15 problems to complete. Since Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, we can calculate the time it will take her to finish all the problems by dividing the total number of problems (15) by the number of problems she can finish in an hour (3). 15 / 3 = 5. Therefore, it will take Faye 5 hours to finish all the problems.",TRUE,5,5,

On Saturday he filled 5 bags up and on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags, bringing the total number of bags to 8."," If each bag had 5 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total? ","Context: There are 2 pencils in the drawer with a weight of 10 grams each. Tim placed 3 pencils, each weighing 12 grams, in the drawer. Now there are 5 pencils in the drawer with a total weight of 58 grams.
Problem: What is the total number of pencils?
Relevant Variables: Number of pencils (changes from 2 to 5)
Irrelevant Variables: Weight (changes from 10 to 12)
Explanation: As the problem deals with the number of pencils, which we already have, there is no need to consider the weight of the pencils when counting the total quantity.
Solution: Initially, there were 2 pencils. 3 more were added. Hence the total number of pencils is the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5. FINAL ANSWER: 5

Context: Frank was collecting cans for recycling. On Saturday, he filled 5 bags up, and on Sunday, he filled 3 more bags, bringing the total number of bags to 8.
Problem: If each bag had 5 cans in it, how many cans did he pick up total?
Relevant Variables: Number of bags (changes from 5 to 8)
Irrelevant Variables: Not applicable
Explanation: The new variable ""Total bags"" is added, which represents the total number of bags collected by Frank. It is independent of the existing variable ""Number of bags"" in the original passage. The units for ""Total bags"" are not related to the units for ""Number of bags,"" fulfilling Rule 4. The augmented passage does not add any numerical information about the existing variable (number of bags) that did not exist in the original passage, fulfilling Rule 6.
Solution: In order to find the total number of cans Frank picked up, we need to calculate the number of cans on Saturday and Sunday separately and then add them together.
On Saturday, Frank filled up 5 bags with 5 cans each. So the number of cans on Saturday can be calculated as:
Cans on Saturday = 5 bags * 5 cans/bag = 25 cans

On Sunday, Frank filled up 3 more bags. So the number of cans on Sunday can be calculated as:
Cans on Sunday = (5 bags + 3 bags) * 5 cans/bag = 40 cans

Finally, to find the total number of cans Frank picked up, we add the number of cans on Saturday and Sunday:
Total number of cans = Cans on Saturday + Cans on Sunday
Total number of cans = 25 cans + 40 cans = 65 cans
FINAL ANSWER: Frank picked up a total of 65 cans.",TRUE,40,4,
31,"Debby had 30 coloring books, while the volume of her pencil case increased from 2 liters to 3 liters.
"," If she gave away 7 of them, but then bought 35 more, how many would she have total? ","Context: Debby had 30 coloring books, while the volume of her pencil case increased from 2 liters to 3 liters.
Problem: If she gave away 7 of them, but then bought 35 more, how many would she have total?
Relevant Variables: Number of coloring books (remains at 30)
Irrelevant Variables: Volume (changes from 2 to 3 liters)
Explanation: The new variable Volume is added, which represents the capacity of Debby's pencil case. It is independent of the number of coloring books variable in the original passage. Volume cannot be derived from the original passage. The units for volume (liters) are not related to the units for the number of coloring books. The augmented passage does not add any information about the existing variable (number of coloring books) at all.
Solution: In order to find the total number of coloring books Debby would have, we need to consider the initial number of coloring books she had (30), the number she gave away (7), and the number she bought (35).
First, we subtract the number of coloring books given away (7) from the initial number of coloring books (30). 30 - 7 equals 23.
Next, we add the number of coloring books bought (35) to the result obtained in the previous step (23). 23 + 35 equals 58.
Therefore, Debby would have a total of 58 coloring books. FINAL ANSWER: 58",TRUE,58,1,
